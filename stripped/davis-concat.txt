well guess kinda hard to do this a single I'm going to part single as it relates to see the houston is lack of development and not just affordable homes but development as a whole which war track more people in from a sector this this were not involved in which the school district is gonna be education there's a domino effect if you will if we are not in the habit of have inhabited educate our kids we don't have a chance to lower development we're struggling right now bringing for the grocery store near northeast corner of Houston and what they do is 1223 my rain rain to figure out the average household income education status as well and it's it's it's kind of sad need to understand their people do purchase food everyday pressure on Sunday's series and the numbers are there but we can get them to buy entire area is because of my education in it because of the homes there in area in therefore we can get the development well public transportation right now you know the new Metro just wrote a couple days ago still looking at that making some type of assessment analyzing the routes the link between routes are going to get back to Metro the board and given a summation as we go to Iraq statements and ask them what they like about you now what don't you like about it and then hopefully we may be defined him some things a bit disheartening that we will have real run throughout district prime opportunity my district holds the incoming Intercontinental Airport and we should have real running through our district directly to the Intercontinental Airport so from those two perspectives about the new Metro in the rail route you will might think that have been more cars on the road the leftover never even taxes were still we still are taken cars off the roads in it and we can steal partner up in Iraq would you for a little while but it's still a hurdle that we have to get over it I don't see us getting to a good solution right now so when the city as big as Houston building and maintaining infrastructure is a huge issue how do you see the city how do you see the city should tackle those issues and how should we pay for it she'll look at this should be we have already 11 districts where the most open ditches in the city I mean streets without curbing gutters which is somewhat attractive in a certain areas when they did the dishes open digital kept tidy sum would need said great transport station in the authority will but we have people come to you to dump in your neighborhood and set out trash before the due date and everyone powers of interest becomes an experiment with open ditches so with that being said we have a long way to go with it as well you look in addition has been neglected for years and years and years and years so we're not getting new streets in your area you are getting the best drainage system in your area there's a problem said no account so I understand that we had to rebuild Houston system now he had their vote on a scale and weigh your options are page you go I believe this system would have more confidence in Houston if they saw streets in the neighborhoods getting fix like the ones I mentioned earlier but they don't see that so that therein lies the problem we can't just put all our money that you collect from john Q citizen the five six seven dollars a month and I get something out of really see something that of it and so we have to go with asthma where we have to go to bed system we have an attribute Houston because it's allowing us in the future we will be adding more streets and drainage streets and drainage areas throughout the city but you have to give the people you know some type of evidence that it it's working for them and so again I'm not right now we can borrow money at this current point time not that expensive the more money for the city of Houston with a rating but if the Supreme Court rules and then we can have reviewed Houston well the overcrowding issue again that's what the governing into the HISD board I would love to get into that I really would I believe that they will work hand-in-hand there's a symbiotic relationship again we don't work which in the beginning with a paid to three times more there and still having adequate amount of children per person per teacher in a classroom is a necessity you know I told you about the lack of development and how it the domino effect occurs with education but I do believe that we will he said they're only talk to the people and show them what any tax increment would actually look like a small town hall said into what it will look like and what we could do with that money as a whole and more importantly how it can come back to our district now area and it served as a platform for the smaller kids 123 years of age before they get that opportunity to get into a jazz day instead they need to have those classrooms that are somewhat tight with all the kids it's not so bad because they have a firm foundation in so I really wish that we take that opportunity or some focus some group or groups would would have that time to go out throughout the city make the presentation and then have a conversation with electricity issues and trying to figure out if this can go at any text you see there r you really don't see there but we have space available cap I believe there's an opportunity to make the city of Syracuse University they were yesterday so counsel retailers well tomorrow will vote on the language of what it's gonna read to the estate is a vote in November it's an opportunity again we heard clearly throughout the city I don't assume everyone but I know a large group stated that they want to see it on the ballot and so that's what we did we vote YES to get it out to the people in November so they can make the final call and we could have repealed at the table but we didn't you just put it out there because that's what the people want to do so will you be in support of the ordinance or I guess against the ordinance in a sense when it goes to the ballot Joe diss diss ballot is not for me it's for the for the people and we had a chance to vote on as a council member and now we put it we voted yes to play that got in for the people to vote on so I guess what I'm saying is would you be voting for the ordinances day and I guess as is or to repeal it forward to guess not be in effect for the city of you so I guess ok I guess I misunderstand because we we voted not to repeal it and so we voted yes to put it back out there I i guess im trying to get out is when it does go to the 22 when it does go to the people are you going to be in support of the ordinance or against the ordinance opportunity for when people really understand what's out there on this with equal rights ordinance in the protected classes that you have you know I believe what five eleven cases that were bought with intense 2014 and 2015 was out there they were basically we're based on race and I think the people really need to understand what the audience really about in so I've been going out to civic clubs in certain areas in giving them briefly so they can make a true assessment for themselves need to vote in affirmative or negative well it's a struggle when we say the steps that we should take its not up to the locals issues that's going to be in the state to figure out for the local control or not we've been looking at things the last three-and-a-half four years ago never been able to vote on the budget for years and try to make some savings to put money to this to decide to start finding our debt liabilities in so we just have to come in every year with a plan like you but you budget your house or you know your peers value there was a budget at their homes we have to figure out what's important is how we set money aside because as my father always say we have answered arose in the years extradition laws in those extra things come up its intelligent mature hardcore court choice in terms of most things because it's a necessity in so he can't seem to do the budget in the mood for it again I'm just trying to figure out how would this season have a specific policy over a privately owned entity but if we have to do as a city council member understanding the landscape is that we have to make sure we can go back to that goes back to the budget to make sure we budget accordingly understand that our sales tax and other taxes that that's ready to the city of Houston in how we pay our bills are going to be affected as their you know have been affected right now and we have to project at the future that when you hit you know I don't know how bad I don't know you know what is going to be like but we do have to again work on a budget make sure that we are putting money aside not generated Spain and take on other new things and making sure that we have enough money in the bank so I guess I don't know what policy we can actually have but that's where the city councilman worse would have a role in the mirror as well well I'm sure my prize say neighbourhood policing like this something new but we've been we've been doing a with the police and you know now one of the things that we have to work on his maybe the house without working on the webcam we're short police office we stayed for 10 initiative to words we entice law enforcement officers to live in the city Houston in those neighborhoods that's one thing that's going to help you know you know so again we have more offices we we have the capability of doing more as you say community policing because we have to really understand led with short short officers they doing XYZ new kids pull them off you know something's going on at their place in the neighborhood to pull them off to go get a bad guy and so is an opportunity to build I guess more but more bridges with our community and our police officers by actually have enough police that's when they have the opportunity to go out there to make sure they're not just a mess in there are negative but go above and beyond to get be more positive when they do have the opportunity to be in those communities so I would say getting into know certain people in certain areas is going to be a place match so sure that by the cameras going to be the answer you look around the nation or just turn your television or you channel your computer you going to see all these incidences are being our own thing and the same situation where you now so by the camp is not the answer they also locally we have to get an understanding of when the police officers gonna he said to turn on at all that footage is evidence or who can look at that footage showed there's a lot of things are going to go go into that again I do say that when are you know in the field now I just can't see the cars yet to get out make yourself known and so those are things that he so I guess if we say 10 chance the community policing that we have now well this is my third time I've had the pleasure to serve not only did constituents throughout the city but especially decisions industry be together we've been able to address some issues and come up with solutions and one reason why I say I need to have led to continue to represent you work with for you is because we have some things that we need to continue to finish and so we started this road again I want to complete with you we are in the cameras now some good some bad guys and so we would love to continue to work with you in be represented District B
