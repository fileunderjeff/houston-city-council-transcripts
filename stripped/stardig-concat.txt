as you said that it's it's a two major issue facing the city but at the same time there's more moving parts that need to be identified and data collected than people are are talking about it's more than a sound bite it's more complicated and you've got a lot of commitments that have been made by prior administrations that we're trying to honor at the same time we're trying to make it sustainable for those that we will be returning out in the future also we have a lot of new hires so as the new hires come in you know they they were counting on those to help support some of the few you no doubt outcome of the ones that are in the pipeline so we've got a lot of moving parts that have to be considered it's not just a matter of just change the system here that a lot in the campaigns and that's that's where I'm a little uneasy about the conversations I think the public understands that there is an issue and without everyone coming to the table under the current the current structure in a green won't move anywhere so we have to we can't be beating up on our employees at the same time and expect him to come to the table and work with us first of all we should be beating up our employees and in the first place we appreciate all of our employees that all the work they've done they do a fabulous job it's nothing it's nothing personal it's a it's about the making sure that there is retirement there for him in the future so do you then in terms of strategies for addressing the pension issues I do support local control it depends if it'd been under the current administration would've been uncomfortable with it because they did not the current administration does not have a good working relationship with fire for example and if we had local control under the current situation I'm not I would've been confident and comfortable with moving forward with local control now to say that legislature meets again to get that local control at that point depending on who the next mayor is that unfortunately plays into this as well so if they can't work with the next mayor must be able to work with fire police and employee only employees but for the citizens for Houstonians for all of us for all of our future that's another another one that's under a lot of scrutiny with the rebuilt Euston and the current system I think the reviled was a great approach very conservative approach pay as you go but we also know that the current needs in the system and if we continue to push our needs down down the road they were going to paying a premium for that for that construction for the infrastructure so while we are saving money and paying down some of our debt we're causing more costs down the road in my opinion because it's gonna come at a premium so we you know what the construction costs and all that are involved we have to forecast that when is the best time to build you know because you wanted to make it affordable as possible you want the best deal you know when the bargain hunter I want to make sure that I i get the best deal for the city and for the the taxpayers in to make sure that we responsive as well right now you know if we continue with the rate we're going with the potholes my goodness I'm I'm on a first name basis with Discount Tire guys that's not a good that's not a good place to be so we need to make sure that we we find a happy medium there and work towards that I think that citizens expect that their tax paid the taxes they paid for the last 50 years so they get something for for their money and that they they can have good roads drainage is a huge issue drainage in in many parts of the city houses have flooded in the last two major events that's a real issue that we've got to to make some corrections there I actually drove the my entire district with the Director of Public Works and we highlighted night I showed him the areas that need attention immediate attention and I think there's some quick fixes and I think there's some long-term fixes that can make a real difference on getting water out of people's homes and keeping it out of their homes to make sense on that same thread of infrastructure what is your vision over the next few years for public transportation in Houston right now I'm concerned about getting to ninety down and that's actually a text at project but if it's impacting are you know my district my district starts you know it's i-ten 610 West and goes all the way out to Texas Children's Hospital past the energy corridor near the Barker Cypress area and then just swings northwest and goes across homestead in the cross 290 and takes in Inwood and it captures Willowbrook and we need to make sure that we're we're moving people on the existing roads with what we have and we just don't have lead to keep moving because what we're doing is we're dumping the traffic that would normally be on 290 down that way a doorbell down the new Grand Parkway and onto i-10 in its filling up quicker than they ever anticipated I believe so there's there's current infrastructure issues and transportation issues that we need to take care of so that we can keep people moving west used in northwest Houston we we we were attached to our cars so it's my constituents serve are very dependent on keeping those keeping those roads in place and others other parts of town that prefer rail and other things like that but I know that the talk is that the high-speed rail from Dallas to use to and I said from Dallas to use to not used in the dow on purpose so we we want to make sure that we know if that's the intention because you know they don't even have to come to City Council for permission they you know railroad has said eminent domain in a lot of power for well for two hundred years or however many years it's been and so they can come down the hempstead highway and in doing so I've got you know the union pacific here and then you add the elevated high-speed rail and then of commuter and starts talking they've been talking about coming underneath there in Dublin locking spring grant I'm really concerned about these things and so I started the conversations ahead of time and being proactive rather than reactive and keeping people moving to their jobs and not liking our communities in making sure if if there's more infrastructure that we need to anticipate and negotiate before this happens I don't want anyone to not to be able to get to their job or to to other parts of town it's it's it's just not right that's a tough question I have the energy corridor in my area and I know that there's a lot of a lot of things that impact our community I grew our group her new cinema native Houstonian and so I remember the eighties I remember when the last big impact was i i i spoke with a group of students recently I told him I said I don't want you ever to be in the position I was in deciding whether you go to work go ahead take that job or finish her education I want you to be comfortable in the fact that when you do go whatever choice it is whether it's a trade school or whatever you know that education is passed in high school or secondary that you have choices job choices good job choices something that's you're going to be happy with not that you know it's a default mechanism and that's something you had to do so with that it's every decision I make on council I consider that so one policy or two policies I don't know if they're I think there's a great and you know the answer to that but I think that it's very important that everything every time we every decision we make we do impact all of those things that impact our our students and everyone that's coming out of school and all those all those workers that are working at the energy corridor in across our entire city in the energy sector so it's important to me that they were very careful very responsible decisions I love this question think we had this conversation before we started about technology I am i when i hit hit the office the first time I was all about what technology can we add to to the city the fact of the matter is when we had when I read that the city in 2010 I think it was I feel like we're in the nineteen eighties technology is not was not a priority at the city and we we failed on a number of part because what they would do is they get a project and they would get funded to a certain point and when the money ran out than some of the things that the enhancements and things that they could have done with technology was left off and even if it was a disaster recovery plan or whatever it is they got the they got the basic core function going in in the work around and kept moving so now I think there's an opportunity to communicate is as you said to our citizens I know we have a rollout out with the and I have it on my phone right now my iPhone the tells you when you can put out George heavy trash or your trash or recycle if you don't have that on your phone today I suggest you go I don't have it I didn't have it handy I didn't know you're gonna ask me that question otherwise would have told everyone where to find it but there is a rollout out so there's so many things that we can do to communicate the budget everything to be transparent can be online available there's no reason for anyone not to have information at the city I my staff does a fabulous job of we have an e-newsletter and it has so much information we have a blast we have so many ways of communicating today with Facebook Twitter and believe or not even you know my stage in life I'm all about all of that I am very very capable and thankful that I have a staff as well that's excellent as you say it's what I call the root cause of a lot of the crime is that we we take we need to build the company's and pride in our community what I look at is there's there's still a lot of blight in some of the neighborhoods that while that they are getting their education or they are doing the right thing they're having to live next to an apartment community that has lived out its entire life cycle and it's become in my opinion dead it's dead on arrival and it needs to be you need to go we have what we call slum lords and they're usually not here and because those buildings are there they end up being havens for crime while I appreciate what you're saying is far as you know the programs and all but I look at more of what we can do immediately 22 communities of the blight the Antoine corridor area is in my district and we were able to take down an apartment over there candlelight trails that the condominiums over there and you could see the changes in the community you you can start seeing it Ellis Square went down and you could see it changing and I can tell you if you love thank me for for the work we've done on taking on those slumlords and they're usually they don't live in Houston most of the time their absentee landlords that don't take care of their their properties or the people there are tenants they take their money and then that's the end of it I'm working with some others right now and quite frankly they take advantage of our our of our neighbors and I don't appreciate it at all and so I do everything I can to address the root cause when I called the root cause and for calls for service and other things that it's a drain on our police it's a drink on our fire and it's a dangerous situation for for the people that have to live there with their children and their families it's just not right tell me what you tell me what you're looking for there I focus primarily on you have to you have to you have to focus on public safety economic development infrastructure and within each of those you have to be able to focus on deliverables you can't continue just to constantly talk about it we have a plan to plan and we have a meeting to meet and we have to get projects on the ground when we talk about infrastructure we talk about crime in public safety once again I keep going back to those two things we we have this habit of meeting to me and to plan the plan and quite frankly we've got home soon as I said earlier that are being flooded and that's what this is that's where my focus is is homes are being flooded and we keep talking about it and we keep analyzing it the fact of the matter is we need to get products on the ground and get get get us to city moving forward I am really proud of my tenure at City Hall we've I am a fiscal conservative i watch the bottom line I make sure that look for efficiencies in in the departments and my first term excuse me my first time we had the opportunity to go in and look for opportunities to save save taxpayer dollars because we were at a point where we're gonna have to lay off fire police and so I rolled up my sleeves and made sure that we got into the weeds and we looked at for opportunities to save the taxpayer dollars and we did we had when times are good no one really paying that close attention to the detail when times are bad wow everybody's all we you know we gotta we gotta get it going and we don't want to be in that position we want to be proactive rather than reactive so I want to look for systematic approaches to putting things in plays like with our Fire Department of fire safety to me there should be a priority sad and it shouldn't be at the political will of whoever's you know in the mayor's seat it should be this is the basic amount of training that should be in place and then we go from there and fund outside of that for other things the same thing with police same thing with everything that we do we should have our a systematic approach in place to what our priorities are priorities are and go from there I find I find it difficult some days when we when we we go off on these other things because I really want to focus on lunch vs needs when you talk about wants we all want you know a great world we want a perfect world not gonna you know pick on any particular projects you want all these great things but what is it we really need when we're talking about taxpayer dollars there's a lot of folks out there on fixed incomes they can afford another they couldn't afford a tax increase or another fear so they've gotta be in even if they could do we should be burden them with it we we need to be done here doing what we need to be doing which is public safety water sewer nothing glamorous you know I think I don't come here for you know to do you know to save the world I came here to provide city services and and the role of municipal government what is the role of municipal government actually i voted against it and I voted to repeal it and then I voted to put it on the ballot for the people to decide as it is that important for the people to decide once again it's to me I came here to focus on when this what is what is the role of municipal government what is what is our role in to me our role is to make sure that the sewage is going away from your home good clean water is coming to your home your garbage is being picked up and you feel that you have public safety available to you when you need it and right now we we continue to once again I am very much against discrimination I have had the privilege of being asked to be on this filter Texas Board of Directors I received the angel advocate award this is the first time we've had a automated or at City Hall I'm really proud of that fact and and I know blacks and all those that have worked for so many years twenty-five years in Cata was passed and here we are just finally getting getting a door automated toward City Hall so when it rolled up in a wheelchair had to wait outside for a kind soul door door by an open the door for them those are the things I want to focus on you know the needs of our citizens what it what do we need to be doing things that we haven't been doing in the past that we should have been doing and that are made or is just an example of what how we how we handle things the fact of the matter is that automated or is is yes it's for a person who will chair but it's also for someone that's maybe older or someone that can't handle those big beautiful doors that we have at City Hall so it's not only going to benefit someone in a wheelchair it's also going to benefit someone that may be aging or have has a talent a stroller or whatever the case may be becomes a convenience for others but a necessity for those that really need it so I think these are the things it sort of my moral compasses to to do what's right for all and keep keep focused on that I think that I think there's a great opportunity here to to to get the the police officers in we've been talking about getting our police officers to give them an incentive to move into the city I think we've been working on this for a while now and they came before council and it's been tagged this week so stay tuned for that but we're looking for opportunities to bring police officers that it whether they're coming straight out of the academy or they're coming there are two hear the fact of the matter is they need to be a part of the fabric of our community and I think they would feel a bit more of a connection more passion for their neighbor if they knew what they were you know they were going through on a daily basis and not to say that our current police officers don't know but I think you know when we get them right out the Academy I'm some sort of I wanna capturing right there and should get them you know get on that path of least resistance to home ownership in Houston you know get him to get him into a program I know I'm an old banker so I'm looking for her a package that will say okay if you come to use to it will give you will get you a great rate on this and let's get you settled in Houston cause it also anchors and went to the community and it makes it makes better relations for everyone plus has an example you know they're they're going to and from work and are going through the neighborhoods so there there don't turn off law enforcement 24 still there on 24 7 so whether it's with the LGBT or whether it's with other communities when serb we all focus on the fact that were used only ins and that we're all part of a community to me that's at the pride in taking care of each other I really believe that if you're a good neighbor in this world that it doesn't matter which community you your drama it's we're all used onions and we're all looking out for each other and I i truly believe that sure I'm Brenda started I am your current city council member I asked I ask for your vote I appreciate the opportunity to serve the 200,000 constituents in district day and the 2.2 million
