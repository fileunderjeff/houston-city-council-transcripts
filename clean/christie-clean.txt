quality of life broadly not just environmental call your life but in general good because i think quality of life is is a balanced checkbook i think of the finances are balanced you can you can have a quality of life otherwise we're gonna be stressed for decades if we don't strain that i think also the quality of the area's been a priority of my terms on the city council have been trying to get the city to switch over to natural gas on all their trucks so at every meeting i vote against anything that says diesel and i think with the price of gas low and availability with the fracking and shale development we could switch everything to natural gas have cleaner air cheaper energy when i first went on city council we give the mayor three years half a billion dollars for kilowatt hours can we produce our own energy plants for half a billion dollars and take advantage for ten-year contract for cheap natural gas then a big proponent nine road with the mayor and the first these cycle renting of city bikes to travel around this city traveled with her too many countries to just see what they do with their quality of life issues and in their in their environment so it's a priority in my profession i work on quality internal environment in the body and so everything we can do parks in the trees in the trash pickup the external environment becomes very important to the citizens of use to you so when talkback wildlife one of the things that has been in the spotlight lately has been public transit in houston so i'm curious if you wouldn't mind sharing with us what your vision of public transportation in houston is very good question first very first week that came up and made a statement i'm not very verbose in in every debate and such that i said mr. city attorney in many cases in large cities do we have on discrimination especially in the transgender but any discrimination he said about 10 i said do we need a thirty seven-page ordinance for ten cases and i said right after that word for word on there is there a person of color and have trouble getting into a restaurant or bar call will get you in and will embarrass the establishment i think the the mayor would take the other two or three cases if they were transgender and she could fight for me i just don't think we needed a thirty seven-page ordinance to do it but still i was torn we had three hundred and fifty-seven presentations to the city and there is some tear jerking cases i mean to where it hurt to know that some of the citizens still discriminate and in that initial week i said this city really doesn't discriminate that much i had never done a discriminatory action in my life but if you enforce the law you can stop those ten cases and so i was torn in the middle and i had words after weeks of debate had words written down why i was going to be in favor of it one council member took the business exemptions from 5225 215 then i wrote words why i was going to vote against it was a tough call it really was because houstonians just don't believe in discrimination and i really truly believe that but that one percent that does i think we can stop when it took to business and heaven 15 exemptions i mean exemptions of fifteen employees at st. any small restaurant this town has to have a lawyer almost on call and then i read the section of the city attorney in describing what that proprietor had distinct and say observers to decide who goes and what better we don't need more lawyers in this we can solve 10 cases without lawyers and low business exemption 15 it's almost every business in this city has to be looking over their shoulder on all these cases of discrimination we don't need more lawsuits to enforce and be decent to every human being in the city so on to something more specific and something i guess you're familiar with your currently in the hot seat now is term limits that's going to be on the ballot do you support the three two-year terms or perhaps a 2 4 year are an alternate proposal very good question that that should be the key question in the mayor's race are you willing to do you have the stature to stop away stop the unsustainable pension system give you an example and and in the greater houston partnership in the taxpayers are mad because nobody else has a retirement system like some of the groups and so that the problem one and they're great people don't get me wrong the men and women of the fire department need people and hard-working but they got locked into in 2001 given away the ranch we don't have the range to give away anymore i got locked into it put their lock box and austin we either have to bring that lockbox back to usdan or negotiate sit down and negotiate words technically they don't have to so first six months in office i asked the mayor mayor do you mind if i negotiate with them so i had the firefighters pension board in my office and their lobbyists and just say just give me the cost of living just give me a little bit of the guaranteed investments and they really never had to negotiate they were in a strong position but now with the business community and the taxpayers realizing these or pension benefits nobody else has one of the press conference is the mayor where she was soon somebody and the fire department i hit thirty year exxon retiree said you have a pension like that not even close to give you one example it's the worst case i could get out of the consultant 52 years old you just put in thirty years i hand you a check for $750,000 and i guarantee you a hundred and forty-seven percent of your highest salary in those thirty years the rest of your life you can't do that and i love the firefighters and says but they have to have their union to to bring that down citizens can afford it city can afford it it'll be structurally imbalanced budget for decades if we don't look at illinois's you know they can't afford what they do they can't even pay their lottery winners chicago is headed in the state of illinois detroit mayor correct me say we're not detroit we will be if we stay on this course will have to take money away from parks and libraries and streets it's just it's serious so it should be the number one issue and mayor's race in the boaters need to hold that promise accountable fix it in two years 63 they don't you shouldn't vote for him it's that serious so shifting gears a little bit from sort of government spending to individual houstonians i'm curious whether you we've seen this this trend in some larger cities i'm curious whether you support raising the minimum wage and and why or why not well there's disagree agreement on city council you know it's a strong mayor's position and fortunately we've been blessed with some good manners didn't abused his positions and so i didn't see a problem with letting them continue setting the agenda work on the budget so we have a voice that unless its nine votes we don't have veto power some of the council members want to have just a few people put things on the ballot in a sixteen people you an absolute extremes so you just don't wanna spend 18 hour days dealing with the discussions of the extreme so highlights the status quo that's from i just think better way to do it you you work with the power structure the mayor tired from different parties but we trust each other anything i asked her a citizen's complainer whatever gets done and and you know if you deal with respect and honesty and fairness you know those officials the ones that have known that the mayors in the past they want what's best for this city is not just hand-to-hand combat politics and getting back at people i work with the system the way it is and i can get things done working with the powerful mayor's position than trying to skirt it and have coalitions to usurp the mayor's power issues newly-elected the previous mayors duly-elected their votes and that's what the city one so you work with the number one spot you can be a city council member and say i'm bigger than my own so anyway i like negotiation compromise trusting each other that's the pretty part of public service but as some other parts to
