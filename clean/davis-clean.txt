well guess kinda hard to do this a single i'm going to part single as it relates to see the houston is lack of development and not just affordable homes but development as a whole which war track more people in from a sector this this were not involved in which the school district is gonna be education there's a domino effect if you will if we are not in the habit of have inhabited educate our kids we don't have a chance to lower development we're struggling right now bringing for the grocery store near northeast corner of houston and what they do is 1223 my rain rain to figure out the average household income education status as well and it's it's it's kind of sad need to understand their people do purchase food everyday pressure on sunday's series and the numbers are there but we can get them to buy entire area is because of my education in it because of the homes there in area in therefore we can get the development are we going to get good morning in our ask the constituents can we go out to take more money out to fix our roads so first week of school in hisd so schools are on her probably every parent's mind in houston we have some overcrowding issues some under performance issues in our public schools i'm curious what you think you seem to be doing to address those challenges well tomorrow will vote on the language of what it's gonna read to the estate is a vote in november it's an opportunity again we heard clearly throughout the city i don't assume everyone but i know a large group stated that they want to see it on the ballot and so that's what we did we vote yes to get it out to the people in november so they can make the final call and we could have repealed at the table but we didn't you just put it out there because that's what the people want to do so will you be in support of the ordinance or i guess against the ordinance in a sense when it goes to the ballot joe diss diss ballot is not for me it's for the for the people and we had a chance to vote on as a council member and now we put it we voted yes to play that got in for the people to vote on so i guess what i'm saying is would you be voting for the ordinances day and i guess as is or to repeal it forward to guess not be in effect for the city of you so i guess ok i guess i misunderstand because we we voted not to repeal it and so we voted yes to put it back out there i i guess im trying to get out is when it does go to the 22 when it does go to the people are you going to be in support of the ordinance or against the ordinance opportunity for when people really understand what's out there on this with equal rights ordinance in the protected classes that you have you know i believe what five eleven cases that were bought with intense 2014 and 2015 was out there they were basically we're based on race and i think the people really need to understand what the audience really about in so i've been going out to civic clubs in certain areas in giving them briefly so they can make a true assessment for themselves need to vote in affirmative or negative so with oil prices well below $60 a barrel many houstonians are a risk for losing their jobs and thousands have already well policies and programs should be in place to protect our cities communities and economic and it and the economy as well well i'm sure my prize say neighbourhood policing like this something new but we've been we've been doing a with the police and you know now one of the things that we have to work on his maybe the house without working on the webcam we're short police office we stayed for 10 initiative to words we entice law enforcement officers to live in the city houston in those neighborhoods that's one thing that's going to help you know you know so again we have more offices we we have the capability of doing more as you say community policing because we have to really understand led with short short officers they doing xyz new kids pull them off you know something's going on at their place in the neighborhood to pull them off to go get a bad guy and so is an opportunity to build i guess more but more bridges with our community and our police officers by actually have enough police that's when they have the opportunity to go out there to make sure they're not just a mess in there are negative but go above and beyond to get be more positive when they do have the opportunity to be in those communities so i would say getting into know certain people in certain areas is going to be a place match so sure that by the cameras going to be the answer you look around the nation or just turn your television or you channel your computer you going to see all these incidences are being our own thing and the same situation where you now so by the camp is not the answer they also locally we have to get an understanding of when the police officers gonna he said to turn on at all that footage is evidence or who can look at that footage showed there's a lot of things are going to go go into that again i do say that when are you know in the field now i just can't see the cars yet to get out make yourself known and so those are things that he so i guess if we say 10 chance the community policing that we have now
