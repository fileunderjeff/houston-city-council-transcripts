the biggest challenge facing the district actually happens to be the challenges facing the entire city we are in a crisis a fiscal crisis crisis that we've not seen some time but it's been coming for twenty years we are now 3.3 billion dollars in debt and that doesn't come that does not count the pension issues that's another three billion in debt and actually if you think about it it might be five billion in the reason for that is that right now we are planning on having 8.5 percent return for our pension but you're not going to have that the market this year under 7.5 percent return they'll end up being a five billion dollar budget deficit so right now we're we're being crushed we have max out your credit cards are roads are in disrepair we don't have enough proper drainage and that's because the city's been mismanaged for the last twenty years we need to change it and so i think thats the the the big crisis that we face in this the fiscal issue which than all other issues are secondary but just as important again the roads drainage the police these are the issues that are going to rely upon how we deal with the fiscal crisis so there's no specific challenge to voters on the west side that you can say i'm i'm looking at your neighborhood and your neighbors and this is what i see it's the fiscal crisis in the fourth as you determined that crisis the fiscal situation to challenges that face the city well we've got issues we got to the bus lanes in investing post oak that's a concern we've got the guests were widening that's a concern these are concerns but i think we look at those who while they are concerns to the people in those areas and should be addressed and those those people need to be brought into the discussion so they have some effect on that again the entire city the fiscal issues with crushing us and so while those are areas of important the bus line should support the galleria area it's not important to the kirkwood eldridge area my areas actually a fairly large area i'm broken down into sort of 5 sub districts because each one has its own special unique issues like a river oaks people think that's for the wealthy living on having problems there with their streets in their drainage are are miserable and we're talking nineteen-thirties infrastructure they they need work done on there is just as much as the people out there in the elder jury need the work done on that area so there are some areas but like i said i think the whole city faced this is what we need is when somebody who's going to address this fiscal crisis and be strong enough to stand up to them to the insiders and say no no more no more spending we need to solve it now we're continuing with the conversation about infrastructure and transportation would like to know what your vision for public transportation is so i thought i think a big issue with her school's been overcrowded we're essentially a sanctuary city i'm opposed to that i'm not opposed to legal immigration i am opposed to illegal immigration i do think we need to clamp down that i think that could alleviate some of the overcrowding they were having in the schools as for the actual schools themselves whether some needy buildings i know that there's been a lot of schools of fish now because they don't have the students and other state schools that are being they have their i guess you come trailers drive my see through three treasures and tomorrow see 45 traders and that's how they expand i think hic knees look into that when you look at your tax bill have your money goes to a child's day the city's only about 50% of what the hst is spending and i don't understand why spend so much time looking to see where i could save some money but again that's an hiv question so you mentioned sort of the way our city government works and as you know we have one of the strongest wrong mara systems in the country i'm curious with that limitation on power for members of city council how do you see yourself effecting change within the constraints of our government system i do not support it is a multitude of reasons and i'll settle for that means i can in the time we have i run through the whole 35 pages i went through it as a lawyer as a lawyer it's a lawyer's dream if you want to see people if you want to defend people well it's probably dream to make a little money off this that's not the way should be it's bad for business it's drafted horribly there's a number of ambiguities in there and we'll give you one example they talk about military status to discuss that you cannot discriminate based on military status they tried to find its military service but that's not the common we knew that would statuses i was there for a number of years i have no tree service somebody who's serving right now his military service but somebody who's not served still has military status their statuses they're not military so there is there is the rub their the languages used there is ambiguous and so as it is it'll be litigated and they they would probably lose it but the fact is even if you lose your still gonna cost me thirty $40,000 defend it well that's not what businesses need to be doing that's what stifles our economy so there's a number of other areas in there that do that even the process itself returned into inspector general anesthesia general investigates and then you turned into the city the city attorney in the city train prosecute detainees be doing other things besides that and we don't need to have be sick in the city attorney on businesses there's also a redundancy is with federal law i don't think it's needed i think there's plenty of laws at the federal level that will protect people and then the other thing and it just comes down to it especially my area but i think most people have a problem with the fact i know said mrs. this doesn't do it but it is it will read it and you actually read what it allows it does allow men who think that women to go into russia and i bet it would allow women who think they're meant to go into men's restroom that's the corollary you know i'm always thought xxnx why this is the way it is we have a misery in the women's room if we want to make a third-round thats finds make a third row but as a men's room is women's room and i don't understand that and i'll tell you i've got friends who are on the far right and those on the far left him throughout the spectrum and there's a lot of people although across their offended by that well as someone who is a member of mensa i am sure you understand that it's more gender is more complicated than xxnx why you're you're smart enough to know that i do want to make clear to viewers something that you mention when you first started which is litigation which is there isn't a mechanism to sue people you a private citizen can't sue someone just wanna make sure that you understand that you as an attorney couldn't file a lawsuit under the equal rights ordinance when i read your dance i think i can when i read the ordinance is if you are in violation of the law and this this isn't as imposing seems not just civil penalties but criminal penalties and you can find five to five thousand dollars but some of them to you that to say you violate this lawyer now believe my rights to the fact is we might think it's not gonna be used that way it will absolutely be used that way and that i don't know me lawsuit argues that way but the mechanism in the law is to report these things to the inspector general me inspector general takes it from there well that's the process does the process but if they don't do anything with it especially general doesn't do anything with it the person consuming because it's still an ordinance you can't discriminate if they feel that that they were not done with that is just administrative function if you don't like the way it's been handled the administrative level you can go in outside that was interesting lawyer's opinion you mentioned the pension several times tonight and we'd like to know what your plan is in terms of how the city addresses its pension liabilities well i think a lot of that happens to be the land price because we go to build something that large you need to look at a large space and there's not a whole lot of those spaces around him a little bit out westchase area but of course it's all about up but the fact is that much as he can do with that they want to do eminent domain and i don't think that's a proper purpose or use of eminent domain there that's me i think that should be used rarely and very seldom i think that that's the crux of it i'm not sure what we can do either don't believe in giving tax abatements that's not to say there can be some of that but you hate to give away your revenue base just to get a business increased revenue base i just don't see the purpose of that i think we can do a better job market and sell in the city i think we have the people are doing a good job of that they're just two things the city has it goes against every year and that's heat humidity and we can do about that it's a selling point the winner it's a losing point force in the summer but i think houston is it's a great city it's a city where anybody can come into houston and succeed they can come it is there's opportunity for anybody who's willing to work hard and do the job right i think that's a selling point for this reason that big companies are coming into higher when those type of people they want that attitude they want the person has a can do attitude america east and that he has anymore but as texas still has it and she still has it is that we can do anything is what makes this a great cities who makes a great state i think there's the company's coming in see that they know what the fact that might be on the outskirts might be in the county or in fort bend county whatever they're still gonna get our workers who are living in houston as people can you reverse commute we can still sell the quality of life we were having a really good job of that if you go to new york chicago their commuters huge and it's like hours in traffic where you take the train or you live in small apartments now here you can have a nice house with a nice backyard with your two dogs two children have a bbq at night and it's a nice life that's always in every part of the city and there are areas i just drove through coming here their heirs are still undeveloped down in the south side of my district by district pretty well developed access there's not a whole lot lands available there to put anything and you would have put industry there nigga put a big plans for you can put large buildings there other than commercial buildings and i think we're doing that by the way i think the commercial side forget a lot of people coming on that side i mean you know we are in the indian capital have the energy corridor and they're still build another the cranes are still up there and i just as exciting for that so we need to be doing a whole lot more than just what we are doing well i think that you touched on something which everyone used to spread of which is opportunity that we do have economic opportunity here and that it's a working city it's you you come here now for our scenic mountains although some of us do you think it's beautiful but because the chances are you have in the diversity that we have but houston does rank 15th worst in the country major cities for income inequality so what are your plans to bridge the gaps caused by that sacked yeah your problem let me answer i don't have a problem with income inequality and the reason is i aspire for more ok i came here to houston law school i had less than $100 on me i could borrow money and buy shirts another guy didn't have any money didn't have a car yeah i was coming from law school i had a good job but the fact is that i have no money i worked my way through college and work my way through law school scholarships or a hundred percent of my effort i was working 40 hours a week i was a dock worker working 40 hours a week while i'm at the college of law school won by the way when it's a law school i slept in a closet with my head that far from the toilet sex lives in efficiency so i could afford to ask for 27 years old football game ok and i'm doing pretty good but the fact is i worked hard and when things it did for me as i wanted better i used to have these little lamborghinis my wall in my local officials apartment looked at him i looked at him i wanted lamborghini so much i still have a by the way but i'm still working because i'd like to get one someday i'm sure that they can afford one i probably bikes and other things to buy instead you know i do a lot with rescue animals i'd rather be the money there but the fact is i want to aspire for this not just for the sole fact of having money but for the fact what you can do when you get it when you have it you can give to charity you can do the rescue groups you can do all these things you can't do otherwise you know i drive through verizon out of their houses and others houses i don't mind working hard to maintain they deserve it i don't like the class envy i don't like the envy as long as nobody keeps people down as long as it's not as if there's a silver people can't buy their own effort and hard work then we need to aspire for more and maybe some people may not want that some people who say you know what i don't know work 80 hours a week to get there but i do wanna do is have a quality of life i want to be at home with my children 5 o'clock i want to work this way wasn't all that either against long as the government and the people are not being kept down the government's to keep the people down and keeping them from aspiring achieving and that's the girl i always think that people should aspire to be better in every way be better materially but spiritually health wise i'm trying to lose weight and that's a promise used to be a really good restaurants i came to houston 180 and i'm 250 i'm telling you is not because i'm cooking but it's one thing he's known for its restaurants but you know we spy we aspired to make ourselves better in other ways and when i see somebody who's done in the meantime i yeah especially lost weight a friend of mine defenseman lost a lot of weight and i looked in their doubting my god you look great last three years and i was like i was inspired me i'm not just the fact he lost the weight i haven't just aspires me now to work harder at losing the way so that's why i'm saying this would help income inequality which will get why is it is we need to look at whether as a result of government interference or whether it's just a matter of market forces so you're not at all concerned about social unrest or gaps in educational opportunity or different things that might especially come out of income inequality i'm always worried about gaps in education holding i think an educated population educated workforce educated people are required for good democracy and good government i think our schools a failed us in their respects i some because schools are just trying this can't do it and others the schools decide what ryan i see a substitute teacher at the school at my mom and dad about teachers and i saw education through different lights and other people have in our family my brother sister and i both have all three have law degrees we aspire to education i think education is way out of poverty i think education is the way an absolutely wrong because like people going to college right now there are two hundred thousand dollars they're not walking out of the hundred thousand dollars occasion i told my friends advised gonna get today probably electrician or plumber i just paid a plumber almost as much power as i charge is a lawyer and i still want to go through all that he had throughout training leading me what you get with our educational material and i thought you know that's good job you can make you $700,000 a year being a plumber or electrician least only don't have enough of them but you know you be skilled in that regards and so that's where you need more education so that you can actually go master electrician master plumber that ensure question it does ok so just as a follow up on john's question we've we've talked a lot about the city's finances and resource allocation so what role do you think improved technology plays improved data plays in making better decisions in the resource allocation and financial decisions in the city i support term limits he support keeping them in their current form for radiative i support term limits i do not like the current form like i would rather have it be and it's on the ballot to four-year terms of one more further in this i've been saying this for years a lot of times you lose good people and understand the requirements because you're so you people in there that are not good in there and they just get stuck in there and it's just there there but i think if you served well she set out for a term potatoes have you served for eight years and then set out for eight years and you're good enough the people want you back in then you should be able to be back in if you're not well then you shouldn't be and you won't have the power of the office to the power of incumbency to win so it takes out the power of incumbency but allow somebody who has actually gotten older tensely tiber on that line to come back in office if they were just shoes choose to do so but that's not what's on the ballot ice put on the ballot i'm not planning on if i r and i want to get my six years my eight years there's no higher office for me and i'm not plan on running for city council down the road desire to change it and i will be running for mayor city council you might that might be your plan now but something happens i think around that horseshoe you know i'm too old for that and other things to do like a lot of fishing be done so i want to fix the city have a good life and go fishin and that's right life in the quiet life that sounds like quality of life one of the things that is most vibrant and reflects our diversity in the city is that we do have a really wonderful theater in museum district's but we've also been criticized the city is not doing enough to support small arts organizations and independent independent artist if you were elected what would you do to make sure that there was a well-rounded thriving arts community and i'm not a fan of minimum wage i pay higher than minimum wage i believe market forces i believe in the free market i think that you should pave somebody what they're worth some people who are starting out her 17 18 year olds have no skill and really show up so they're working for places maybe mcdonalds are some places her first job these are the people that i know basis though now some 50 year old person has two kids to support your figures on some minimum-wage battle and skill in 30 years i don't know how to help you then but most people about 75 percent of people are on minimum wage are minimum wage are the younger people first jobs i got a when you hire somebody as a first-year lawyer as well as money on them because they might have gone to law school didn't know how necessary to do the law so we write off more than we get it goes for anybody has her first job and i think we did the minimum wage allows you to our people you might not a wise hired if you're going to be a tenor $15 do automation that person doesn't get a job and they don't get the skills they can't move up one of my first jobs was being a swing shift manager trainee mcdonnell's it paid attention to more an hour then just a regular employee but i gotta start officer employee and then they may be within a week sweet shop manager trainee me what mention i worked late shift but ten cents an hour more but i aspire to just be a minimum wage i want to be beyond that within a couple months i was beyond in wage and he'll pay me my way through school addition to dock working so in four directors and everything else i did but you need you need to have his place to start seeking develop your skills and get into the habit of going to the office showing up on time doing the job and being a reliable employee will
