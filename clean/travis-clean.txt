so we like to start off with her district candidates with something that you know is on the mind of everyone who's looking at these hyper localized elections right a little slice of our city which we want to know what is the biggest challenge facing your district and how would you go about solving the biggest challenge facing the district actually happens to be the challenges facing the entire city we are in a crisis a fiscal crisis crisis that we've not seen some time but it's been coming for twenty years we are now 3.3 billion dollars in debt and that doesn't come that does not count the pension issues that's another three billion in debt and actually if you think about it it might be five billion in the reason for that is that right now we are planning on having 8.5 percent return for our pension but you're not going to have that the market this year under 7.5 percent return they'll end up being a five billion dollar budget deficit so right now we're we're being crushed we have max out your credit cards are roads are in disrepair we don't have enough proper drainage and that's because the city's been mismanaged for the last twenty years we need to change it and so i think thats the the the big crisis that we face in this the fiscal issue which than all other issues are secondary but just as important again the roads drainage the police these are the issues that are going to rely upon how we deal with the fiscal crisis so there's no specific challenge to voters on the west side that you can say i'm i'm looking at your neighborhood and your neighbors and this is what i see it's the fiscal crisis in the fourth as you determined that crisis the fiscal situation to challenges that face the city well we've got issues we got to the bus lanes in investing post oak that's a concern we've got the guests were widening that's a concern these are concerns but i think we look at those who while they are concerns to the people in those areas and should be addressed and those those people need to be brought into the discussion so they have some effect on that again the entire city the fiscal issues with crushing us and so while those are areas of important the bus line should support the galleria area it's not important to the kirkwood eldridge area my areas actually a fairly large area i'm broken down into sort of 5 sub districts because each one has its own special unique issues like a river oaks people think that's for the wealthy living on having problems there with their streets in their drainage are are miserable and we're talking nineteen-thirties infrastructure they they need work done on there is just as much as the people out there in the elder jury need the work done on that area so there are some areas but like i said i think the whole city faced this is what we need is when somebody who's going to address this fiscal crisis and be strong enough to stand up to them to the insiders and say no no more no more spending we need to solve it now tension some of the infrastructure problems in your district and then obviously we know there's aging infrastructure around the city when i'm curious about is how do you think the city should tackle those infrastructure issues and had had to be paid for it that's good point there's a lot of people out there that are not happy with the rebuilt euston i'm not happy rebuilt euston but it's actually in concept a good concept it's been implemented and properly our current mayor has now properly implemented the program and i tell people i said you know you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater if you look at greece you think that capitalism and free markets aren't any good but i believe in capitalism and free markets and i said i say the same thing's rebuilt euston their ass bitch about it i don't like the drainage fee necessarily i don't like the way it was put on the ballot and i don't like the worst first scenarios when it comes to decide which roads need attention we don't need to have the worst first objective standard i think most people understand with a drive down a road which roads are bad which ones on but we do need to start paying down our debt and we've maxed out their credit card rebuilt euston allows us to do that again i'm not sound like to modify it change it work with it but i think the concept which is pay as you go pay down debt is a good concept + right now our current budget the general fund has about 2.2 billion in revenue we're going to end up being about a hundred and forty million in excess of that our expenses seventy percent of that the police the fire so when we look at this we don't have a whole lot of money in that budget to put into the rose rebuilt euston does that will put a hundred billion dollars into the rose right now and we'll put 400 million right now we have a depreciation in our roads with 16,000 lane miles and i cant talk on the drainage and stop the lane miles with 16,000 nine miles 15 percent are in disrepair we have with drainage and with roads we have five hundred million dollars a year in depreciation really put me into it which means we have a deficit of four hundred million doesn't take a genius to know that we're behind the eight ball on this one so we've got to do is pay down our debt and by the way our debt equals about 425 its repayments are right now about 425 so free to pay that down and put that money in which we now are equal to 500 million and i think that's the best way to the alternative is i don't like to alternate the alternative is going out there issuing bonds but then how do you pay off the bonds with taxes and then that for taxes and that for increased taxes plus my district is very wealthy district we have some the house valuations if that's going to happen bonds were sold my district up a disproportionate amount of those taxes of course the district council i cannot before that we're continuing with the conversation about infrastructure and transportation would like to know what your vision for public transportation is well along the rows of metro is that we're talking about public transportation as you see it i don't see rail i know people like real that went well they think rails the way to go promise rails once you set rail down and you fix rail if the populations move or the people move the rail doesn't follow them so i think with public transportation i think we should stick with the bus bus lines i think we should work with metro on this diet a look and let the buses that run empty they run into i think we need to be evaluating these services from for the value for what do we get for that because just put a bus down a road that serves 34 people isn't sufficient i know that we're being under these i just drove down here and i ran along a rail line all the way down here along scott street in this turned up here and it's nice it's nice to have that but i didn't see anybody out there on the rail and so when i look at this and thinking what is the value that we're getting for the kids were putting millions and millions of dollars in as we as a city put money into metro the course metro put it on the radio so i think we need to stick to the bus stop the bus lanes i think we need to promote them better let people know whether the schedules are stick to the schedules i have no problem with having large buses that go from outer areas from out side houston or or to the edges of houston in two trends to commute the the various employees who are working downtown or in the galleria i think those makes sense but again i don't think we need to go to rail and you mentioned earlier that there was some talk about buses in your district in in terms of the post oak area can you talk a little bit more about what your vision for for public transportation that area as well and post oak area here are everywhere industry g again that's the problem i have with with this with the bus lanes is when people go down to the gallery impose though they're going down there to shop or to eat they're not going to practice on a bus taking on trying to put in their car most people there like the cars are going to drive their cars we need to be thinking in terms of the cars are because people we're trying to change behaviour but we really shouldn't come then the behaviors that exist and i think that when we try to change them and make them leave their car and go to a bus were failing because people are gonna do that the people that go down there to the galleria go down to post up go to go to memorial city or go to town city centre these are people are going to shop there in terms of packages a nap in the trunk of the car the baccarat shibi grab something to eat and they're gonna enjoy your time they're not worried about the bus schedule so let me say one thing about the public transportation is not public transportation but it's a long same line it's super lists the lift system they're competing with the cabs and for that i love competition i think is doing a good job i have some issues with some the checks on the background checks i think we need to be serious about that but which are public transportation that's also public transportation has people taking care absent from the airport to their houses and costing $80 and honestly who you were you can do 425 for making money on their butts happy why should the bus be happy so i know this is an issue in your district but citywide we have some significant issues with our schools we have issues of overcrowding we have issues of underperformance i'm curious what your thoughts are on how we should address those issues with our public schools so i thought i think a big issue with her school's been overcrowded we're essentially a sanctuary city i'm opposed to that i'm not opposed to legal immigration i am opposed to illegal immigration i do think we need to clamp down that i think that could alleviate some of the overcrowding they were having in the schools as for the actual schools themselves whether some needy buildings i know that there's been a lot of schools of fish now because they don't have the students and other state schools that are being they have their i guess you come trailers drive my see through three treasures and tomorrow see 45 traders and that's how they expand i think hic knees look into that when you look at your tax bill have your money goes to a child's day the city's only about 50% of what the hst is spending and i don't understand why spend so much time looking to see where i could save some money but again that's an hiv question well the economy is it an issue always course but we'd like to know that in light of recent oil shocks and layoffs in the energy industry what role do you think the city of houston gameplay and diversifying our economy and the industry is here well i think the city has been diversifying that i think market forces will do that big believer in free markets and i think the market's decide so those industries that are waiting and waiting for a reason and the people that are losing jobs there will find jobs in other industries now is your transition for that sure do people need to read job-training yes i think that's it i think thats a good job for ages hcc do open up new areas in mumbai india were qatar i think we need to focus on helping people retrain here in houston for the city i think the best thing we can do is make it so that's a good place to open up a business in particular i think with that we need to worry about the permitting requirements if you get on the houston website and you go through all the permits they're required to open a business you just go through it tournament and threw it through it i am not exaggerating power to go through this is how is streaming through looking all these requirements permitting fees it overwhelms people you have to be a lawyer to understand it you shouldn't have to be a lawyer to understand it and open business and i think that's the best way because most businesses think was that six out of 10 job creations in america are started by small business that's we should be encouraging i think we need to encourage the entrepreneurs and part of that is making sure that i have to fight red tape and work with the people city hall i mean it's not so much the city hall necessarily as a bureaucracy in the city i've heard horror stories i myself have been involved in the war stories is trying to get through to the mid-level people it's impossible if i ran my business the way the city runs its business i'd be out of business and i know everybody else out there does private business would be as well but the difference is i can hire fire people so many screws up and doesn't do something right they don't get the proper service to my customers are gone they can't do them city but when the people call in to get help so they can start their business so that they can be the entrepreneur they want to be then those who need help as opposed to the right and i think we focus on that so you mentioned sort of the way our city government works and as you know we have one of the strongest wrong mara systems in the country i'm curious with that limitation on power for members of city council how do you see yourself effecting change within the constraints of our government system that is the key isn't just a question we also know what to do is just can't we do it alone city councilman doesn't have the power to do that by themselves unless they can build a consensus unless they can get other people to come along number one i think im likable person so i'm hoping that will hold me in good stead with other city councilman one of the things i'm proudest of is that it's not 24 years i've never lost to trial and what that means is that i getting up in front of it i don't do car accident cases i do commercial litigation so we're talking about but i get to go up front of a jury of twelve men and women and within two to three weeks to convince them of my case my client's case i get to get him to win them over to my side and i've done that successfully now never lost there's reason for it because i know how to bring them around as they happen to be the most certified mediator i've had never mediations my life i can count how many hundreds and hundreds of mediations and i know how to bring the parties together and i know how to solve the problems so with that said we intend to do is work with every city councilman his own counsel with me as well as the mayor developed a good rapport and then hope to educate them the way i'm educate myself on these issues on the importance of addressing them as opposed to just kicking the can down the road as i look at this right now with this shit that's a swamp the swap city hall needs to be drained i'm not an insider and outsider i plan on coming in and fix the problems well we at the houston equal rights ordinance now on the ballot is this was passed by city council but now is a hot topic again and we would like to know if you support the equal rights ordinance and why or why not i do not support it is a multitude of reasons and i'll settle for that means i can in the time we have i run through the whole 35 pages i went through it as a lawyer as a lawyer it's a lawyer's dream if you want to see people if you want to defend people well it's probably dream to make a little money off this that's not the way should be it's bad for business it's drafted horribly there's a number of ambiguities in there and we'll give you one example they talk about military status to discuss that you cannot discriminate based on military status they tried to find its military service but that's not the common we knew that would statuses i was there for a number of years i have no tree service somebody who's serving right now his military service but somebody who's not served still has military status their statuses they're not military so there is there is the rub their the languages used there is ambiguous and so as it is it'll be litigated and they they would probably lose it but the fact is even if you lose your still gonna cost me thirty $40,000 defend it well that's not what businesses need to be doing that's what stifles our economy so there's a number of other areas in there that do that even the process itself returned into inspector general anesthesia general investigates and then you turned into the city the city attorney in the city train prosecute detainees be doing other things besides that and we don't need to have be sick in the city attorney on businesses there's also a redundancy is with federal law i don't think it's needed i think there's plenty of laws at the federal level that will protect people and then the other thing and it just comes down to it especially my area but i think most people have a problem with the fact i know said mrs. this doesn't do it but it is it will read it and you actually read what it allows it does allow men who think that women to go into russia and i bet it would allow women who think they're meant to go into men's restroom that's the corollary you know i'm always thought xxnx why this is the way it is we have a misery in the women's room if we want to make a third-round thats finds make a third row but as a men's room is women's room and i don't understand that and i'll tell you i've got friends who are on the far right and those on the far left him throughout the spectrum and there's a lot of people although across their offended by that well as someone who is a member of mensa i am sure you understand that it's more gender is more complicated than xxnx why you're you're smart enough to know that i do want to make clear to viewers something that you mention when you first started which is litigation which is there isn't a mechanism to sue people you a private citizen can't sue someone just wanna make sure that you understand that you as an attorney couldn't file a lawsuit under the equal rights ordinance when i read your dance i think i can when i read the ordinance is if you are in violation of the law and this this isn't as imposing seems not just civil penalties but criminal penalties and you can find five to five thousand dollars but some of them to you that to say you violate this lawyer now believe my rights to the fact is we might think it's not gonna be used that way it will absolutely be used that way and that i don't know me lawsuit argues that way but the mechanism in the law is to report these things to the inspector general me inspector general takes it from there well that's the process does the process but if they don't do anything with it especially general doesn't do anything with it the person consuming because it's still an ordinance you can't discriminate if they feel that that they were not done with that is just administrative function if you don't like the way it's been handled the administrative level you can go in outside that was interesting lawyer's opinion shift just a little bit from from over to law enforcement and obviously this has been the law enforcement's relationship to communities are very hot topic least sometimes with tragic results so i'm curious what your view is on how we can improve salon 14 spent relationships with community to color the glbt community and the community in general in houston i support the police had some issues but i support the police and let me say i think that they are outmanned a lot we have right now about 5280 police officers least 5,400 we suspend 440 million ten years ago for 5400 we now spend almost 900 million for class officers the population has grown daughters of that we have a little bit officers were flying desu they're not out there on the streets i always think that the best way to police the broken windows policy i still believe that keeps the crime down if you're out there in the community be invisible and you're out there in lacking crime stays low and people get to know you if you're driving police cruiser erupted asked him where you're not out there with the people so i'd like to encourage that i know there's been talk about people putting more police on the streets in another 750 million or so we don't need to do that we need to do is take some of the police that are already on the deaths we have to me too much bureaucracy there too much paperwork we need to transfer some 2,000 people find a desk and with that we can take 33 percent of those just 33% we will cut about 600 officers on the street just like that no change is a simple that no it's not a simple but yet it sort of this that's the concept is beyond that it's going to take some time but that's the way to do it now work with people of color and work on those you be lgbt community i'm not sure i don't know the interactions are amanda what's going on now and it was just an officer shot out there i know there's a number of people who were thinking it's a black blue issue i don't see it as i see that the police are actually protecting the citizens and the citizens are pledging now so happen to be under developed communities has a lot of crime there i don't see police officers in my community and we don't have a reaction have to pay extra for constables a problem got destroyed she we don't have police officers we don't have the police there we see one a month and they're driving through so what we do in our communities and everybody has to pay extra we pay an extra $700 in my my subdivision for police that we are you pay the city i cant attacks to have a problem that i like to see police officers in my area as well and the reason for that is to survey says look please go where the crime is mike yes the crime goes to the police are not and so if you don't have police and community in the crime could come in so just to inform the viewers at home our second guest has not yet arrived and so we're going to continue talking to mr travis until until our next guest arises if she arrives so i john what's your next question for our guests to get tougher now around 200 they certainly we certainly appreciate you being here with us tonight it's it's been a pleasure talking with you we do want to cover a number of topics and we would like to talk about pensions you mentioned the pension several times tonight and we'd like to know what your plan is in terms of how the city addresses its pension liabilities is more complicated to get into tonight we got plenty of time to take longer but let's start with this i believe in defined contribution plans i think we need to move to defined contribution plans immediately now i'm also i understand that people have already made decisions or commitment in their lives based upon what they expect i believe in upholding contracts i believe in living by your agreements city council did and i don't like with that said i would live with agreements for those who are currently serving the police and the and the fire but from here on out there all new hires to be defined contribution number one that makes us pay as we go we are unfounded and we're being a more unfunded every day there's an mtv last night was actually out of it today and foundation came out and talked about how much were underfunded back in 2001 we are underfunded by three hundred million today run funded by over 33 million ok so in that short amount time we've had it's not that hard if you think about it in terms of your own credit card payments if you're supposed to make a payment of $100 and you can make a payment of 50 with an extra fifty you did not pay goes to the next month you got interest and then the next month you gotta pay $150 954 still pay 50 then you've got two hundred acres over now issues one big snowball it's a mess and it needs to stop and he stopped now and every says that every politician who once said that every year they just don't do it but we don't have this we don't have the luxury of this anymore we are we're chicago was ten years ago ok we actually have this is the thing is not just a pensions but we have more debt than detroit has or had 11 bankrupt fortunate more revenue right now but it may not last attack alice right now and part of that happen to be going to a defined-contribution immediately and the other part that is just funding the pensions if you made a commitment you need to live by commitment and i think you know there's more to it i say this because we may need to know first of all the prior you need to have local control and with police in this poll we have meeting confirmed that then heads up there we'd make sure that we as a city have absolute control over our contracts for pensions with our employees and they need to be real with a with the with our employees need to be real with us when i met with a fireman i told him i said look guys you guys think that's defined contribution because if you go this way thirty years old in twenty years from now you may not have any you may be from a bankruptcy court the bankruptcy court should decide your retirement the jacobi 30 then you're going to 55 maybe sixty so this is something we gotta dress down for these guys were thirty or forty the guys that are six is retiring again they've made the commitment made the agreement can you live by it but the people are coming in how we had a save it for them so you were mentioning earlier that you think that houston should do what it can to attract new businesses as you know a number of major particularly energy businesses have built new campuses around you stand but not actually in houston so i'm curious to hear what your thoughts are on what the city can do to try and attract the exons and the fm cease to look at he soon as a city rather than just the suburbs well i think a lot of that happens to be the land price because we go to build something that large you need to look at a large space and there's not a whole lot of those spaces around him a little bit out westchase area but of course it's all about up but the fact is that much as he can do with that they want to do eminent domain and i don't think that's a proper purpose or use of eminent domain there that's me i think that should be used rarely and very seldom i think that that's the crux of it i'm not sure what we can do either don't believe in giving tax abatements that's not to say there can be some of that but you hate to give away your revenue base just to get a business increased revenue base i just don't see the purpose of that i think we can do a better job market and sell in the city i think we have the people are doing a good job of that they're just two things the city has it goes against every year and that's heat humidity and we can do about that it's a selling point the winner it's a losing point force in the summer but i think houston is it's a great city it's a city where anybody can come into houston and succeed they can come it is there's opportunity for anybody who's willing to work hard and do the job right i think that's a selling point for this reason that big companies are coming into higher when those type of people they want that attitude they want the person has a can do attitude america east and that he has anymore but as texas still has it and she still has it is that we can do anything is what makes this a great cities who makes a great state i think there's the company's coming in see that they know what the fact that might be on the outskirts might be in the county or in fort bend county whatever they're still gonna get our workers who are living in houston as people can you reverse commute we can still sell the quality of life we were having a really good job of that if you go to new york chicago their commuters huge and it's like hours in traffic where you take the train or you live in small apartments now here you can have a nice house with a nice backyard with your two dogs two children have a bbq at night and it's a nice life that's always in every part of the city and there are areas i just drove through coming here their heirs are still undeveloped down in the south side of my district by district pretty well developed access there's not a whole lot lands available there to put anything and you would have put industry there nigga put a big plans for you can put large buildings there other than commercial buildings and i think we're doing that by the way i think the commercial side forget a lot of people coming on that side i mean you know we are in the indian capital have the energy corridor and they're still build another the cranes are still up there and i just as exciting for that so we need to be doing a whole lot more than just what we are doing well i think that you touched on something which everyone used to spread of which is opportunity that we do have economic opportunity here and that it's a working city it's you you come here now for our scenic mountains although some of us do you think it's beautiful but because the chances are you have in the diversity that we have but houston does rank 15th worst in the country major cities for income inequality so what are your plans to bridge the gaps caused by that sacked yeah your problem let me answer i don't have a problem with income inequality and the reason is i aspire for more ok i came here to houston law school i had less than $100 on me i could borrow money and buy shirts another guy didn't have any money didn't have a car yeah i was coming from law school i had a good job but the fact is that i have no money i worked my way through college and work my way through law school scholarships or a hundred percent of my effort i was working 40 hours a week i was a dock worker working 40 hours a week while i'm at the college of law school won by the way when it's a law school i slept in a closet with my head that far from the toilet sex lives in efficiency so i could afford to ask for 27 years old football game ok and i'm doing pretty good but the fact is i worked hard and when things it did for me as i wanted better i used to have these little lamborghinis my wall in my local officials apartment looked at him i looked at him i wanted lamborghini so much i still have a by the way but i'm still working because i'd like to get one someday i'm sure that they can afford one i probably bikes and other things to buy instead you know i do a lot with rescue animals i'd rather be the money there but the fact is i want to aspire for this not just for the sole fact of having money but for the fact what you can do when you get it when you have it you can give to charity you can do the rescue groups you can do all these things you can't do otherwise you know i drive through verizon out of their houses and others houses i don't mind working hard to maintain they deserve it i don't like the class envy i don't like the envy as long as nobody keeps people down as long as it's not as if there's a silver people can't buy their own effort and hard work then we need to aspire for more and maybe some people may not want that some people who say you know what i don't know work 80 hours a week to get there but i do wanna do is have a quality of life i want to be at home with my children 5 o'clock i want to work this way wasn't all that either against long as the government and the people are not being kept down the government's to keep the people down and keeping them from aspiring achieving and that's the girl i always think that people should aspire to be better in every way be better materially but spiritually health wise i'm trying to lose weight and that's a promise used to be a really good restaurants i came to houston 180 and i'm 250 i'm telling you is not because i'm cooking but it's one thing he's known for its restaurants but you know we spy we aspired to make ourselves better in other ways and when i see somebody who's done in the meantime i yeah especially lost weight a friend of mine defenseman lost a lot of weight and i looked in their doubting my god you look great last three years and i was like i was inspired me i'm not just the fact he lost the weight i haven't just aspires me now to work harder at losing the way so that's why i'm saying this would help income inequality which will get why is it is we need to look at whether as a result of government interference or whether it's just a matter of market forces so you're not at all concerned about social unrest or gaps in educational opportunity or different things that might especially come out of income inequality i'm always worried about gaps in education holding i think an educated population educated workforce educated people are required for good democracy and good government i think our schools a failed us in their respects i some because schools are just trying this can't do it and others the schools decide what ryan i see a substitute teacher at the school at my mom and dad about teachers and i saw education through different lights and other people have in our family my brother sister and i both have all three have law degrees we aspire to education i think education is way out of poverty i think education is the way an absolutely wrong because like people going to college right now there are two hundred thousand dollars they're not walking out of the hundred thousand dollars occasion i told my friends advised gonna get today probably electrician or plumber i just paid a plumber almost as much power as i charge is a lawyer and i still want to go through all that he had throughout training leading me what you get with our educational material and i thought you know that's good job you can make you $700,000 a year being a plumber or electrician least only don't have enough of them but you know you be skilled in that regards and so that's where you need more education so that you can actually go master electrician master plumber that ensure question it does ok it seems to me like you have a pretty clear vision of what healthy thriving houston is to you know what i'm curious is when you if you were like to end your honor city council and you're working on making policy to serve their constituents what would you say are your top three quality of life indicators that you would be looking at to make those policies let me start off by saying that even though i'm running for district g and i would be a district councilman counsel for the entire city i will be a fierce advocate for my district and make no bones about it i will fight for all the dollars i can for that but i also now when i can be underwater selves offers not a row because wrapped around a strategy is the city goes down just 3g goes down so we need to make sure that we make decisions not just for this treaty before the entire city and i intend to do that with quality of life i think that you know when we take a quarter life everybody has a different view of vision of some people's view is being on a luxury cruise in the bahamas other people at the ski and some people are just having a wonderful family bbq in the back from the quality of life happens to be where people are happy they they have meaningful valued lives which means they have good decent jobs which means they have good communities they don't live in fear they don't worry about being shot lawyer study another mothers bad people should have to live in fear as i think when we talk about quality of life and think we do need to make sure that we look at the crime issue we look at mobility been stuck in traffic is not a quota of life issue if you're stuck in traffic an hour each way you're losing two hours a day think about all the hours you lose your lifetime that is not qualified life so i think we need to be looked at those in terms of like reverse commutes much used as we've got like six or seven downtown ounce i say six or seven is one downtown medical downtown anymore but we have the gallery is like its own downtown the medical center in downtown a lot of people i come here they look down our downtown houston ago i was not that big star compared to chicago new york but then we start shown in other parts of the city and they realize how massive how big the city is we've by the square miles that's a big city and we've got our downtowns the city centre immoral areas becoming a downtown plaza was done it i think is good people can work and live there i also think it's great if they can work there and live there and work out and they became the fact is we can you reverse commuting we can we can encourage people to do that by encouraging businesses to locate certain places but i think we talked about quality of life that's when asked about making sure that you know your home in time to see your children play that softball game are being at play practice make sure you have a good job make sure you can save for the schools of the college or what you have you want or that trip to bermuda with on the packers but also that you know that you have food on the table you can pay your electric bill you can pay for the ac on the heat which ever offered organization that's over 90 years old the league of women voters loves the fact that we begin to use technology to reach out to voters and reach out to citizens to make sure that they have all the information that they need to make an informed decision it's also why we're interested to know how you would use technology to better serve and communicate with citizens well we're doing it now campaign will do it as well i still go the old-fashioned way i think bestest in person i expect to make myself and i will make myself available throughout my the community you won't have to come down to city hall to see me i will come out to the various areas in my district and see them so i think that's always the best way to put faces to names to gather the personal touch but with that said we've got to twitter we've got her website we've got facebook got email we've got text messaging people be able to text me people email me i don't want to be one just sending things out to me i want to be a two-way conversation and thanks a lot and he's been a one way conversation it is be with her telling me i'm just listen so i intend to do that expected that right now these are things we have for our campaign and we are doing that again it's a two-way conversation la times a lot of times it's a lot of people tell me what you're thinking like to hear that lets me know then what's going on in district in the community ok so just as a follow up on john's question we've we've talked a lot about the city's finances and resource allocation so what role do you think improved technology plays improved data plays in making better decisions in the resource allocation and financial decisions in the city actually question here's the problem see right now and the city's moving towards this action actually sort of impressed with it but they got a long way to go the website direction so much easier people get on their find information immediately i believe in transparency number what i believe that every decision has been made on council has been the website and all the votes but he was more important when people want to do something i started business they need to know how to start a business what do i need and here's the thing is like right now we are having an issue the permitting process permitting lot of people's not on the radar it affects the city greatly affects the congressman developers effects reminders of a friend of mine who's down the street was added on garage apartment to rent apartment over a year around the house for over a year and the reason was was the permitting process analysis section process but the permitting it was taking weeks sometimes months to get the proper permits and you can't start something like the proper permits so we have an issue down there i like to see that we do not go more digital on this where people can submit their plans to julie where they're actually i'll be observed its last edited the paper i might be right now where when you do this you get one person you're dealing with a set of every time you go in the permian you get a different person in a different person mark set up differently we look at this we think it's not a big deal unless you're a developer but the problem is developers either have to eat that cost rep acid on down and lay pastor down to my friend not all that the lot of it and so this costs of doing his garage apartment went up because the delays and that's that's just sucking money out of the economy and the state we need be doing also a look at the parade featured as a whole different thing charges but the i think that we move more to a digital web based and we can interact with people the more we can do with people on the web the more information they can get with him we don't need as many people pick up the phone answering calls or what's happening now basically say to the person that person a person they get to run around with people good luck to the city they want an answer and i don't understand why the city just can't give the people answer i mean we are servants of weird public servants are servants and the need to serve the public internet wanna do that they shouldn't be involved in that i think everybody wants the their elected representatives to serve them more and be more focused on service even the even the ones that they consider great so it's it's comforting to hear that as a candidate for city council let you know what your position is on term limits i support term limits he support keeping them in their current form for radiative i support term limits i do not like the current form like i would rather have it be and it's on the ballot to four-year terms of one more further in this i've been saying this for years a lot of times you lose good people and understand the requirements because you're so you people in there that are not good in there and they just get stuck in there and it's just there there but i think if you served well she set out for a term potatoes have you served for eight years and then set out for eight years and you're good enough the people want you back in then you should be able to be back in if you're not well then you shouldn't be and you won't have the power of the office to the power of incumbency to win so it takes out the power of incumbency but allow somebody who has actually gotten older tensely tiber on that line to come back in office if they were just shoes choose to do so but that's not what's on the ballot ice put on the ballot i'm not planning on if i r and i want to get my six years my eight years there's no higher office for me and i'm not plan on running for city council down the road desire to change it and i will be running for mayor city council you might that might be your plan now but something happens i think around that horseshoe you know i'm too old for that and other things to do like a lot of fishing be done so i want to fix the city have a good life and go fishin and that's right life in the quiet life that sounds like quality of life yes my husband would absolutely agree with that plan so we've we've been talking sort of morris specifically on a broader question i'd like to ask you to houston has now surpassed even new york city in being the most diverse city in the country which has incredible opportunities and also some challenges that go along with it so can you tell me what you see as the value in houston's diversity and how can the city capitalize on the fact that it is so very divers will again houston i don't think houston started off trying to be diversity just became diverse became diverse because of its sounds hokey but it really is the opportunity people came here because they could make a living they succeed they could develop and build something so i'm not saying that we set out to make a diverse it just became diverse and diversity right is excellent i can attest to that when i when i travel when you travel abroad there's not a whole lot of diversity in certain places not only the people but with cuisine i don't have to leave houston in order to have some the best cuisine in the world and i i can actually travel the world and used in food whether it's weird but lacks in french but italian food mexican food this is we have the diversity when it comes to the cuisine but we haven't asked what the people and i think it's interesting the way they interact in fact i think we as in houston are an example for the rest of the world think about it we have muslims jews christians hindus live in another thing they're worried near each other they're worried about is whether you mowed your yard ok we're not having issues are fights that they have other parts of the city or in a city in parts of the world if you look at what's going on in europe right now there's a huge issue the mass migrations there are not having those issues people might be concerned about the illegal immigration coming from our southern border but we're not sitting there shouldn't be there for these reasons we're not sitting there attacking each other for this reason the crime is crime but it's not a crime based upon diversity we have people who are living together in a melting pot and i think that's a good example for the rest of world was speaking of diversity one of the things that is most vibrant and reflects our diversity in the city is that we do have a really wonderful theater in museum district's but we've also been criticized the city is not doing enough to support small arts organizations and independent independent artist if you were elected what would you do to make sure that there was a well-rounded thriving arts community let's back up a little bit i'm not so sure about that part but we're not doing enough i say this for this reason the mayor took 85 million from the hotel occupancy tax and put it towards the arts his ticket but if they're not the streets not drenched just took it and put to the arts i thought a lot of money so somebody says round enough i'm not a believer the print money somewhere solves a problem but there's a five million that's going from hotel tax that she took she got an award for it i think she should have gotten the word for it to be the prettiest site the prettiest art is a well paid straight when i drive down a smooth street that start with that said i enjoy small theaters i don't go downtown to the alley theatre that often i do go on vacation i'm not one who likes to fight the traffic i actually go out to the theaters out of my area there's a lot of small little playhouse theaters where we actually are sitting from here to you as far from the stage that's it it's more personal is made about 60 or 40 people in the audience i've seen some of the best players there what i like about the city to promote those more like you do not exist i mean you shouldn't he's depressed to find them even then they're not there and you know if you don't know these parts area's existing your committee won't know go to them and i think the city can do that on the website that's one of the things that we can do is promote the small groups and give them a voice give them some exposure same thing for artists and artists must do a show you know i like doing our show my my my father taught art teacher i like i like going to shows like the best ones we go to his old houses and they have a mini got your glass of wine you walk around you to see the art are doing see anywhere else are that you you don't even know existed and then you get to meet the artist for the call i'm are that way so i think that should be promoted i think these are things again that the city does not displace fund money to these entrepreneurs are just need exposure these people need to know where they are on a saturday or friday or thursday simon says what you want to do tonight and services hey let's go to this art show where do you find it i thought on the city website will we have time for another question before we do some wrap-up remarks and so we we've talked a lot about the economy and quality of life and what i'm curious about we've seen several of our other large cities in the country raise the minimum wage as an end in terms of a quality of life issue trying to improve the quality of life i'm so curious whether you support raising the minimum wage and i'm not a fan of minimum wage i pay higher than minimum wage i believe market forces i believe in the free market i think that you should pave somebody what they're worth some people who are starting out her 17 18 year olds have no skill and really show up so they're working for places maybe mcdonalds are some places her first job these are the people that i know basis though now some 50 year old person has two kids to support your figures on some minimum-wage battle and skill in 30 years i don't know how to help you then but most people about 75 percent of people are on minimum wage are minimum wage are the younger people first jobs i got a when you hire somebody as a first-year lawyer as well as money on them because they might have gone to law school didn't know how necessary to do the law so we write off more than we get it goes for anybody has her first job and i think we did the minimum wage allows you to our people you might not a wise hired if you're going to be a tenor $15 do automation that person doesn't get a job and they don't get the skills they can't move up one of my first jobs was being a swing shift manager trainee mcdonnell's it paid attention to more an hour then just a regular employee but i gotta start officer employee and then they may be within a week sweet shop manager trainee me what mention i worked late shift but ten cents an hour more but i aspire to just be a minimum wage i want to be beyond that within a couple months i was beyond in wage and he'll pay me my way through school addition to dock working so in four directors and everything else i did but you need you need to have his place to start seeking develop your skills and get into the habit of going to the office showing up on time doing the job and being a reliable employee will we are now at the end of our our so what i'd like to do is provide you with about a minute to address the audience somebody watching at home and tell them why you think they should vote for you well if they want the same if you want to say i'm not the person if you want to stay the course and allow the city to deteriorate that's not me i'm the outsider i've received the common problems i received the endorsement of the greater houston builders association the american council for engine companies as well as the houston association of realtors i'm receiving all the business endorsements because the business people know what the city needs to run if we want to drain the swamp of city hall if we want to have the transparency and if we want to finally fix these problems we need people who are willing to do it people that are willing to stand up and not worry about what said about them we don't need a placeholder we don't need somebody who just goes along to get along we need a bucket and i wanna be that advocate for just regime for the city of houston
