well that's exactly right the the mayor is the one who calls the shots in houston but council members are important too they are able to shine a light on things draw attention to things they're able to convene meetings in in pull people together and look for opportunities to get people to collaborate and work together so so it's a very important role and i intend to make the most of it houston equal rights ordinance is going to the november ballot what is your position on the ordinance and why do you feel that way it it is a huge part of our future needs to dress in really tackle and just took ages has a lot of really great opportunities i'm with the red line that goes north now in an extension have to the community college and also the greenlandic goes into the the east and so district age has a total i think of twelve stations along the rails that's a lot but you know this and their stations are nice you get out and it's nice but then what they don't connect well to their neighborhoods around them so we have we have a lot of work to do to make it really effective he said that we we did transit oriented development we need walkability to those areas you know at least a quarter of a mile so that it will be effective in really taking advantage of the investment this big investment in building this this this infrastructure you know that that we will be collecting housing and jobs in places people want to go because right now you can you get off and in the end it's not it's not easy they don't don't take people far enough into the neighborhoods we don't have enough housing options and and now in development along there i mean i think there's a lot of opportunity for 222 use that just very very good development and growth along those twelves stations industry gauge that's just about that why did you let me talk about other transportation oh ok well this is a huge issue and as more and more people moved to houston in a lot of them are they're coming they're coming in big numbers they're saying you know in another 20 years we'll have another million people in the loop now therefore million in the suburban ring so that's what we're talking way into the future and it's really time to be thinking about that now how that's gonna happen so so as we're we're doing a better job and now we've got some light rail not enough we've got this re-imagined bus network that's a really good start to you that's just got launched in this so some tweaks i think that need to be made but that's that's a valiant effort you know that they will be and another bike lanes at her pad that our country he said recently that's a big plus too but we need to be thinking beyond those things to the future eventually with all the the millions of people that are coming to this area we will need commuter rail and when that happens we're not ready for it because the existing rail system that we are afraid they would have in our city that business is also growing and then that same time period that it their capacity will be exceeded by because their their growth is expected to also double so those are privately owned businesses we're not gonna get real from them unless they have something better so what we need to be thinking of and i'm not really hearing a lot of talk about this but eventually we do need a new friend system free trail maybe i can i try track system around the city that connects to the poor and would allow them to the existing rails to be turned over for commuter rail so those are long term and expensive investments and so we need to get hold of you know if our city's finances and and get beyond just thinking of how we make it to the next day in pacha pothole to thinking about how we're going to manage transportation because it's really gotta be multimodal it won't be one thing anywhere we have a lot of different people here and it's it's not a one size fits all kind of system so we need we need we need everything we need to be thinking about it now after so term limits are going to be on the ballad how are you voting on the term-limits proposal and what are your thoughts about term limits and industry in the city of houston i would say they would all around community and neighborhood that that that quality of life comes from people feeling like they're part of the community that they're safe that they're you know they're they're not going to be burglarized or attacked by packs of dogs are you know walking out into the street and there's no there's trash that's been illegally dumped across from them you know that their infrastructure safe in in place you must decide walks the streets are a good dose of those are things that would measure i would also i also think that they're looking at the quality of our schools is is it would be a fair assessment to because even though it will largely falls on the school district in the schools you know for what they do i just so strongly believe that that the city's role in supporting the schools is also important in in should be an indicator of quality of life
