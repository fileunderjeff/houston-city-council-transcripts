your first question so under the charter houston city council members don't have a lot of power it's a very strong mayor system in the mirror controls the agenda given that limitation how will you affect change for district age as a city council member well that's exactly right the the mayor is the one who calls the shots in houston but council members are important too they are able to shine a light on things draw attention to things they're able to convene meetings in in pull people together and look for opportunities to get people to collaborate and work together so so it's a very important role and i intend to make the most of it cisneros what do you feel is the biggest issue facing district age and how will you address it the biggest issue facing just took ages the the disparity that exists in industry cages at post too much of the rest of the city we are increasingly becoming a us city of haves and have-nots just rich gates has more than its fair share of have not finding his lap in equal across the city and the same issues exist the poor infrastructure public safety in the city budget all affect what happens industry gauge it just seems like it happens more so because of the low income families that just aren't as effective in advocating for themselves related question actually research center used in leeds the entire country in terms of economic segregation when where people who have low incomes live in certain parts of town of people with high incomes live in another to search that that's pretty evident yesterday's you have certain areas are very high development in certain places that have very low income so how will you make sure that all of the stage has equal opportunity that is posed really the challenge and i'm a good one to two to do that when i moved into the woodland heights thirty years ago it was not the neighborhood that it is now it was a transitional neighborhood and there is not support for the elementary school down the street and i worked as a grassroots reads leaders community activists to be part of that change pulling people together to to change school to changing neighborhood so now when i go out and i'm talking people they say and so much of our district is struggling so we'll hear from you from the river oaks of district agency you don't understand it was not that way i was part of the change i can help you part of the change here too so that's that's that is the challenge you know to lead that's that's what district needs is good leadership and so the houston equal rights ordinance is going to the november ballot what is your position on the ordinance and why do you feel that way i completely support the proposition one i will be voting for it encouraging other people to do the same it's it's it's the right thing to do it's it's the right way to treat everybody all of the citizens that live here all the residents that live here and all of the people we want still to come to you soon either as residents or visitors we want we want their business we want them to move here we want them to two living growing prospering houston and it sends a really bad message if we don't look like the welcoming place that you seem really is so i i am supporting proposition one is this ordinance so there's a lot going on with public transportation right now just a gauge just fairly recently the main line that through the main street lighting was extended up north then you've got their rerouting of the metro buses what are your thoughts on what's happened so far with public transportation is actually industry dates in what's your vision for public transportation it it is a huge part of our future needs to dress in really tackle and just took ages has a lot of really great opportunities i'm with the red line that goes north now in an extension have to the community college and also the greenlandic goes into the the east and so district age has a total i think of twelve stations along the rails that's a lot but you know this and their stations are nice you get out and it's nice but then what they don't connect well to their neighborhoods around them so we have we have a lot of work to do to make it really effective he said that we we did transit oriented development we need walkability to those areas you know at least a quarter of a mile so that it will be effective in really taking advantage of the investment this big investment in building this this this infrastructure you know that that we will be collecting housing and jobs in places people want to go because right now you can you get off and in the end it's not it's not easy they don't don't take people far enough into the neighborhoods we don't have enough housing options and and now in development along there i mean i think there's a lot of opportunity for 222 use that just very very good development and growth along those twelves stations industry gauge that's just about that why did you let me talk about other transportation oh ok well this is a huge issue and as more and more people moved to houston in a lot of them are they're coming they're coming in big numbers they're saying you know in another 20 years we'll have another million people in the loop now therefore million in the suburban ring so that's what we're talking way into the future and it's really time to be thinking about that now how that's gonna happen so so as we're we're doing a better job and now we've got some light rail not enough we've got this re-imagined bus network that's a really good start to you that's just got launched in this so some tweaks i think that need to be made but that's that's a valiant effort you know that they will be and another bike lanes at her pad that our country he said recently that's a big plus too but we need to be thinking beyond those things to the future eventually with all the the millions of people that are coming to this area we will need commuter rail and when that happens we're not ready for it because the existing rail system that we are afraid they would have in our city that business is also growing and then that same time period that it their capacity will be exceeded by because their their growth is expected to also double so those are privately owned businesses we're not gonna get real from them unless they have something better so what we need to be thinking of and i'm not really hearing a lot of talk about this but eventually we do need a new friend system free trail maybe i can i try track system around the city that connects to the poor and would allow them to the existing rails to be turned over for commuter rail so those are long term and expensive investments and so we need to get hold of you know if our city's finances and and get beyond just thinking of how we make it to the next day in pacha pothole to thinking about how we're going to manage transportation because it's really gotta be multimodal it won't be one thing anywhere we have a lot of different people here and it's it's not a one size fits all kind of system so we need we need we need everything we need to be thinking about it now after when we talk about crime prevention we hear candidates talk about how there's a need for more cops and that are equal less crime when we don't deal with the systemic issues that are linked to crimes such as lack of education poverty and other issues so how would you address crime prevention in terms of dealing with those systemic issues that's exactly where we need to really tackle it in the answer isn't just more cops it's not to build more prisons you know that's not what we have to do we need to do a much better job job of supporting our children and i and we do that by the city level by supporting our neighborhoods i've been you know community activist around schools have been a school teacher i've been a school board member and all my experience now his his brought me to the realization that role that the city has been playing to support our children in the is is is overlooked you know i i get pushback from people saying oh you're talking about education in supporting children that's not the city's job it is so this city's child it's all over jobs but that's how it plays out when you have when you've supported children and their families they they grow up to be more successful and law abiding and contributing citizens and then there you don't you don't have the need for taking care of it on the on the other hand you because you've already invested in building people so term limits are going to be on the ballad how are you voting on the term-limits proposal and what are your thoughts about term limits and industry in the city of houston i think if both sides why play some people like that if it's just two years at a time that you don't like something you get rid of them right away but also see the advantage of having people there longer i had the good fortune to work for council member eleanor tinsley when she hired me to be the assistant director of the smart part program after the the program i'll let it my school at travis elementary school and really came to appreciate the longevity she had its city hall and what she was able to accomplish if she had just been doing three two-year terms terms she would not have gotten things done like the smoking ordinance or the billboard bands in the things i took time and i think that some candidates especially people that are are looking to they professional politicians will will will come down with they do because they're they're thinking i need to get elected next time so i can stay and i think you know when there's a longer term it lends itself more towards supporting longer-term thinking and we really do need to be thinking into the future and i will say that i'm not a long-term candidate you know this is this is it for me you know there's if i get elected this time in two more times you know that's it so i on the side of supporting the longer terms so missus narrows what would you say would be the three quality of life indicators that you would use as a metric to develop policy and serve your constituents i would say they would all around community and neighborhood that that that quality of life comes from people feeling like they're part of the community that they're safe that they're you know they're they're not going to be burglarized or attacked by packs of dogs are you know walking out into the street and there's no there's trash that's been illegally dumped across from them you know that their infrastructure safe in in place you must decide walks the streets are a good dose of those are things that would measure i would also i also think that they're looking at the quality of our schools is is it would be a fair assessment to because even though it will largely falls on the school district in the schools you know for what they do i just so strongly believe that that the city's role in supporting the schools is also important in in should be an indicator of quality of life so what are your thoughts on the revenue cap do you think it should be repealed you think it's dan please do you think it should be amended i'm sorry they ever put in place i think it was a political decision that was a little lazy you know and that they should have fought to do things differently it hasn't helped the city and it's it's just been another constraint to the tools we have to navigate through the difficult financial problems at the city's having now so i i would like to see it gone so we're coming to the end of our time with you so we want to give you the last word so if you would like to address the the constituents industry age are why you should be there next city council member ok thank you for the opportunity to visit with you today i would like to say that that experience that i bring as a leader both as a grassroots leader in working at the neighborhood level and also having served at the top of the of an organization like the hic school board having already dealt with million-dollar budgets and dealing with difficult policy issues and personnel decisions gives be an advantage of this leadership explains that i would bring with me to the city council and it would be an asset so i hope you'll support me in this race
