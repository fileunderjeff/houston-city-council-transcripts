unfunded pension liability is a major issue in the city of houston what are your ideas about how to address the current pension issues and how to prevent similar situations in the future will you have to remember that we made a deal with the city employees who are working for the city and the pension was part of the deal and i believe we have to keep our word now you also realize that in reality the city council doesn't have the authority to change in pension policies or procedures this has to be done by the legislature and there's been attempts to do that and they've been unsuccessful over the years so it's important for you to realize that unless we get a grip on not just our pensions but there's many other issues that are looming is well we have a huge debt and if we don't take advantage of the hoarding robust economy of houston at this time and slow our spending down and meet our obligations we have to do that but there is no way to change these things without the state legislature and acting change great thank you for your response to the first question i'm going to belong to a second topic so that would be that inner-city as large as you stand building and maintaining the infrastructure is a challenge so we're interested in how you think the city should tackle the infrastructure issues including how to pay for them well you you also remember that there was a prop one election back in 2010 the very same time that we had the election that the citizens voted out the red light cameras they also voted in what's called prop one which was the dedicated drainage and sewer fund and this dedicated fund was set up to raise funds from getting added to your water bill and its dedicated to to our infrastructure there's been some problems with that we've had thirty three million dollars taken out of it this year to pay salaries of different departments and that bothered me i've made note of it spoke to the to the media about it i've made open statements in council that this is a problem because we had been told that there would be a lot box and we would use these funds for anything but for the fixing of the streets as much as i believe in 311 part of it screaming going to 311 there so many other things it's going to so we have to do better than what we're doing in managing our funds that's one of the reasons why i voted no on our budget last year and i voted no this year because there was inconsistency that i didn't agree with i do not believe you're balancing your budget when you're deferring your pension plans and you're doing out differing other payments i don't believe that's a proper way to run government because you're actually paying your house now with your credit card and how can that make you any better off financially when candidates speak of crime prevention the often proposed a formula of more cops equals less crime when in reality the systemic causes of crime are linked to issues of education issues of poverty issues of opportunity what crime intervention and prevention policies do you support that will systemically address crime now you you have to remember i've been in the bail bond business for nearly 20 years or in the city of houston i've seen crime up front i've seen that i've seen what it does to families every time you see a crime there's about forty-two people that are affected by the crime not just the victim and the victim's families but also of the person who perpetrated the crime and their entire family is hurting people on all sides we have a number of crimes that that you know or low risk rams i've tried to get the government to pay more attention to the fact that if if it's a nonviolent crime then why put a $200,000 bond on somebody who committed a crime of fraudulent instrument and they they they figure out how much the instrument was it a fraud related and then and then they double it for our $200,000 bond and yet you can kill your spouse and they give you a $40,000 bond like they did the lady that ran over a spouse whatever sadies there something wrong with the system doesn't make sense also we have to do better at trying to police our neighborhoods the police chief came to the city of houston and counseling told us that there were 20,000 cases with bleeds it we haven't worked now first of all you should never tell the the the the criminals that and we have a real problem we've had we've had files for homicide departments that have been missing and and later found them to be done worked this is wrong we've got a we have got to get our police better at doing their jobs there's a lot of ideas that you can promote but there's nothing better than just having the police officer's presence in the community is what mayor lanier said years ago he beefed up our police department the crime stats went down you can also do away with your police department crime stats go down because nobody catching crooks and even reporting the crimes too so you have to do you have we have to do better with what we have we have a lot of people in the hierarchy of the police department and very little down low at the ground level so it's fair to say that that formula more cops equals less crime holds true in your opinion is suing the police department is is functional and operating on all four cylinder so to speak we have a computer program that with it we've been we've split fifty seven million dollars for scholars see smart program and that that's at csm ar to you it's not an acronym for anything that i know of just to see smart program we spent fifty seven million dollars for it doesn't work to this day its forests being able to implement warrants for our police department to see who's got warrants on him in their cars this is a defunct system and brought it back in 2006 i thought it when they tried to implement spending that kind of money in 2010 and i voted against it every time the system does not work our municipal courts are now in the red when sylvia garcia was are presiding judge the expenses revenue over expenses reason the 36 million range and in there bill white administration the revenue over expenses was in the twenty millions and now we're in the red we're losing money and our municipal courts area it doesn't make any sense what's going on the long lines at the courts sometimes there's nobody there it's mismanagement the presiding judge is more concerned about where police officer parked his car and reports to police officer to the to the police chief is ridiculous we've got to have better morale among police department switching gears another really the issue its kind of division if you stand so we are interested in learning more about what is your vision for public transportation and transit in houston both in the short term and long term well we're trying to develop a plan here in houston car plant houston you know i learned early in life that if you don't plan to succeed then then you can you plan to fail we have to have we have to have better infrastructure for sure but let me remind you every time you see this congestion in all this traffic and stuff won't tell you what my dad used to tell me that he should boil when you see all this traffic thank god because that means that there's a good economy here in houston i remember during the gas shortages when the streets were bare there was nobody on the roads viewers old enough to remember that in the nineteen eighties i'm glad we have traffic i just wanna have good mobility i would support anything that would help our buses to get to where they're going i know that own own post oak there they want to put bus lines it has been approved by the terms i wanna see more people that are coming into the city from outside the city and rosenberg and richmond and sugarland katie and montgomery county want to come into houston they want to park in rat afraid that i liked hov lanes being open on the weekend why would you close them on the weekend at one of the reasons why i don't go to galveston you try to come in on 45 on sunday afternoon or or anytime you can't get in they close the hov lane now i threw a fit well now they have a pilot program to have them open so i say get on those hov lanes only coming into houston i learned that if we can open up coming in it will also boost our business downtown it would you come into a ball game or an event you know the hov lane is open you can get on it and it'll make the businesses downtown be more attractive to where people know they can get into a nice restaurant are our theater downtown so in terms of technology how do you how do you and how should the city used technology to better serve and communicate with citizens well i wanted to implement a program similar to what the texas legislature has the legislature has a system as you can get on their their website and you can put keywords and anytime legislation has those keywords and you're gonna get an email from the state owned the fact his legislation pending about this matter and you can put a number of keywords in when we get an agenda this released on friday evening at about 6:30 mostly priority home most council members are going from their offices it used to be printed up and put my box and i have to go back either friday night or saturday to pick it up now i can look at it on my computer at my desk and i can read it it's about five or six hundred pages not only with the backup every week and then we have to vote on this phone on wednesday how does a citizen's getting made aware that there's key issues here i say we use technology to do similar things that the legislature did i'm sure the legislature would be more than willing to sell his program to us to let us know what it is we spent fifty seven million dollars on a city of houston see smart program that doesn't work we can have already had that system here in the city of houston it looks like we have time for one additional question because it on the ballot in the fall what is your position on the houston equal rights ordinance and can you explain to the voters what your position is i voted no and the reason i voted no was when the mayor at first addressed council she said it was about a black male that couldn't get into a club on houston avenue and i felt i had a problem with that because i went to that club on houston avenue with one of the reporters from the city of you from hair from from the new media here and we went to that club we learned that the genesis of what this was really all about actually we realize that this wasn't what it was about in fact this decision i told them where should not let you get by with it you can tell us what it's really all about and i understood that during that that weekend dealing with the easter holiday period there there were the greater houston partnership it came in they were cutting deals on what they were going to do and when the when the president of the greater houston partnership to me how things are going to be and how it was going to go i said i haven't even seen a draft of this and you're telling me how the boats going to go i'm the one vote no on this link and so i said look i have a problem with it i talked to some of the transgender community i had meetings with them and they said this disorders as it was worth it really wouldn't have protected them some who had lost their jobs some who had had problems with other things i didn't feel like it was properly drafted plus when the issue came about that a person can go into the restroom of the opposite sex if they felt they were in the transgene during state the ladies responded violently and i got 721 emails opposing this this ordinance so i voted no and and it wasn't because i discriminate against anybody i just felt like that it was a properly drafted it was the 10th to the 14th draft the first one i never seen an at-large councilmember and i demand better treatment from matt from rj mayor and are in our administration that you bring the council members into the inner circle when i ran out said i'm an outsider put me on the inset not tell you what's really going on in city hall and i voted no and that's why i voted no excellent well as there is there anything else that you like to tell the voters of houston about your candidacy for city council at-large position 3 the past 20 months have been the most enjoyable that i have ever been involved in serving government i would have never dreamed possible to enjoy being a city council as much i get to be at the seat of government i see what's going on and i i realize that in the end i'm gonna be judge but not know how many years i served on counsel about how much money i have made but rather how are created the beggar at the gate how i treated the poor and those in need and so i'm continually reminded that we have to stand up for the voters of the city the citizens of the city and that's the least of them we have to be concerned about as well i found myself continually defending the down-and-out hours wow because i believe that supposition i have been in laughs maybe that's why i was a foster parent for years that's why adopted a child because i care for people and i want to do the right thing for the city of houston i've enjoyed being your city councilman for the past year and a half years 8 months and i would hope that i would re-elect me and i would get to serve again for another two years
