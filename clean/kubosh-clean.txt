will you have to remember that we made a deal with the city employees who are working for the city and the pension was part of the deal and i believe we have to keep our word now you also realize that in reality the city council doesn't have the authority to change in pension policies or procedures this has to be done by the legislature and there's been attempts to do that and they've been unsuccessful over the years so it's important for you to realize that unless we get a grip on not just our pensions but there's many other issues that are looming is well we have a huge debt and if we don't take advantage of the hoarding robust economy of houston at this time and slow our spending down and meet our obligations we have to do that but there is no way to change these things without the state legislature and acting change great when candidates speak of crime prevention the often proposed a formula of more cops equals less crime when in reality the systemic causes of crime are linked to issues of education issues of poverty issues of opportunity what crime intervention and prevention policies do you support that will systemically address crime i voted no and the reason i voted no was when the mayor at first addressed council she said it was about a black male that couldn't get into a club on houston avenue and i felt i had a problem with that because i went to that club on houston avenue with one of the reporters from the city of you from hair from from the new media here and we went to that club we learned that the genesis of what this was really all about actually we realize that this wasn't what it was about in fact this decision i told them where should not let you get by with it you can tell us what it's really all about and i understood that during that that weekend dealing with the easter holiday period there there were the greater houston partnership it came in they were cutting deals on what they were going to do and when the when the president of the greater houston partnership to me how things are going to be and how it was going to go i said i haven't even seen a draft of this and you're telling me how the boats going to go i'm the one vote no on this link and so i said look i have a problem with it i talked to some of the transgender community i had meetings with them and they said this disorders as it was worth it really wouldn't have protected them some who had lost their jobs some who had had problems with other things i didn't feel like it was properly drafted plus when the issue came about that a person can go into the restroom of the opposite sex if they felt they were in the transgene during state the ladies responded violently and i got 721 emails opposing this this ordinance so i voted no and and it wasn't because i discriminate against anybody i just felt like that it was a properly drafted it was the 10th to the 14th draft the first one i never seen an at-large councilmember and i demand better treatment from matt from rj mayor and are in our administration that you bring the council members into the inner circle when i ran out said i'm an outsider put me on the inset not tell you what's really going on in city hall and i voted no and that's why i voted no
