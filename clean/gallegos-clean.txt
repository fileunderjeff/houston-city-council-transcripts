will we should do is in regards to you had mentioned he's a community college for example i know that there have been some unemployment regarding the the low price of oil it's been mentioned in the news been mentioned the paper using community college course offers programs you work hard situation to learn other skills and in education and what have you and i think that's something that we need to work with with our hse trustees so that is something that i would work with also regarding the the the revitalization that's going on in our neighborhoods it's also important to work with our chamber of commerce also dcu it what they can do to also that to help hoping that this will be a long trend you know they'll be this is jim temporary trained in regards to the the price of oil as you know city of houston even though it's not the way it used to be back in the eighties where we were basically held hostage in regards to the price of oil i don't personally those can be as bad but yes it's going to affect the city revenue that we take in an economic powerhouse you know we despite some of the sharks happening with the economy right now in the energy industry we're still seeing quite a bit of growth however much of the economic development is actually occurring outside of our city limits for example acts on moving their campus out to the woodlands and now co-champions heading out to sugarland what can we do to really promote business growth inside our city limits well that's where we come in regards to city council we try to provide some incentives for businesses to stay within the city limits you know i'm in when you say that there's a lot of growth going on on the outside i mean i i my district does cover downtown and it's amazing the number of cranes that are in the downtown area in the number of buildings are going up not just in the downtown area mean you look towards the galleria area there's a lot of creams out there as well and also in the medical center so there is a lot of construction going on within the city of houston but yes i do have to agree that we had to do what we have to do regarding providing some incentives so that way businesses if for some reason they're looking at possibly going outside of the city she said that they will stay in the city but i i guess i i destroys it there is a lot of growth there is a lot of things going on within the city of houston downtown medical center in galleria area and you know i i just think that we're doing what we can to to keep the businesses here in the city and again i think some incentives to to make sure that they do state especially now with the price of oil that's something that i think we have to look further to try to make sure that we keep specialties energy companies within the city and now like to turn a little bit to quality of life as we know that it's important to consider quality of life if we are to become the world class city that we are poised to become if we aren't already so what are three primary quality of life indicators that you would use a symmetric to develop policies policy around and server constituents what quality life well as you know the pension is controlled from the state legislature so i first of all i feel that the city is obligated to honor the contract we have in place for our current employees but there is an issue that we do have believers 3.2 billion dollars or something that we have outstanding there what we're looking at in the course will be with the new administration is to see how we can address that in what's been discussed since i've been accounted member and that i've been hearing is the possibility of setting something to wear from a certain time frame on new hire ease would be under a different system but the ones that had this contract we would still on it this contract in hand and i strongly feel that we're obligated to honor a contract that we we we've made with with with with the for example the fire department so those current employees would honor that contract but i believe that from a certain time on it would be under a different system regards to retirement pension and but again its control to austin i understand from listen to some of the mayoral candidates what they would like to do courses to get other cities are having issues like this where we could be a combined force to go to the legislature in two years and tried to get it waits to where it will be handled through the municipalities not asked so that's something that i would support as well houston equal rights ordinance has been quite the topic of debate this year in our city do you support it night well as having community meetings i know our police chief is is out there i had a community meeting basically just to give an update industry dial know what was going on in district i invited the sheaf i was pleasantly surprised to see that he was there at eight o'clock on a saturday morning and to give an update on what the hdd's doing in the community and i've seen him and other events as well similar forums so that's very important is very speedy to be involved in the community to give updates as to what they're doing to address issues of concern and i think hpd is doing an outstanding job in indian bring that information out to the public why have the theater district in industry died and of course i have various small arts groups also with industry died so i've got both groups you could say whining monies for prefer their organizations and i know that they ended up hiring someone to do research on it regards to other cities and what they are doing and that was presented at the quality of life committee me not too long ago i understand this week i received a phone call that an agreement has been reached he regards that the district and the smaller groups in regards to funding in how they're going to proceed with that hasn't been brought to our attention yet the caller ec they were asking my opinion and i haven't seen anything yet so i'm waiting to see exactly what that is and i but the person who did call me said both sides seem to be ok with it so if that's the case then i would be ok with it as well as enzymes or representative represents both groups industry died but regarding details on that information yet and it was that in reference to the hotel occupancy tax distribution to the theater district and i don't even know that yet they haven't come back to committee will be coming back to quality of life to give us an update on what they've discussed in what they've come to an agreement quality of life yet i believe we do have quality of life committee next week but i'm mistaken i'm not sure it will be presented then but i'm assuming issue so that does more than curious to hear exactly what the agreement is to make sure both sides are okay as to possible funding and again the gentleman that was hired to do this research he provided information as to how denver does it how it landed does it how san francisco does so there's options out there i'm just not sure what's going to be presented at the quality of life what is your visit vision for transportation and our city for the next two years then and then to the future or one thing i'm working on is there is a great organization industry tie is as as txr acts they are volunteers basically they're retired engineers in whatever you wear their their teaching students to stem programs they have a warehouse in edo in they've outgrown their space they're looking for a new location the old rufus cage school 1417 telephone road it has the old historic building and then next to it has like two or three warehouses where tx arex is interested in maybe expanding to those warehouses so they've applied for cdbg funding we're waiting to see if they're going to get the approval for the cdbg funding but if everything works well then they'll use that money to renovate those warehouses which really good is that it's centrally located to a lot of schools you can also get high school year the eastwood academy you have a cap jeremy you have jackson middle school edison middle school and i hope several elementary schools in the area which will all be able to participate going there and learning the stems and i think that's very interesting that's something that will benefit to students to encourage them to hopefully going to science and engineering in in in in that something that i do support you know and hopefully we'll hear something regarding the cdbg funding within the next two or three weeks of everything goes well they'll be renovating those warehouses and moving into those were houses there in the east and when candidates speak of crime prevention they asked in talk about formula of workshops when in reality that doesn't necessarily get at the underlying groups root cause of crime crime intervention and prevention policies do you support that can get to that will systematically reduce crime and an add on to that is what can we do to promote new industries that the technology industry or knowledge industries to come into houston was met with the developer this past week myself and councilmember gonzales where the double developers interested in buying some property in near the downtown area and offering the spaces were there not that large where someone can go and they're starting up you know in in technology or other field they can go in and and leased out these small spaces which is much less expensive and then then then leasing out a building or a good sized building what else though the lease are small spaces they'll get started in in in in in their field and their industry and hopefully fournier they will grow in now be new businesses here in the city of houston it's great concept and we're working with this developer to hopefully that that will happen and he's very excited about it you know he feels that this is something that houston needs and i encounter a gonzales agree we were excited about the the presentation that he gave us in we're working to see what we can do to make sure that that does happen so to answer your question is is just helping others that have an idea had a vision of something that they think they can do as a business and we're helping them as a city providing them and space and a low cost though they can hopefully grow their idea and actually become a new business here in the city of houston although it will not be on the ballot this november it is clear that conversations around the city's revenue cap may continue to surface in our next term what effect you think positive or negative revenue cap is currently having on our city and what is your stance on whether or not to lift or modify it why will be well i know that chicago for example they believe the mayor's also somewhat responsible for the chicago in penn school district in houston we have a course are super intense superintendent and we have our hiv trust deeds so we don't have the day-to-day say so as to what's going on at a chinese d but with that said i did meet a nice to speak with my the ajc trustees that are within district i wish there's to cover district nine so i try to work with them to see what we can do for example i know we pass bonds couple of years ago i believe regarding rebuilding our schools and that's something that i have mentioned it at counsel for example milby right now they left at the side of the old school but they tore everything else they own their bill rebuilding that score changed and they want to do the same thing to stephen f austin those two are in the district and i had mentioned that counsel to see you there could be a partnership if they're going to design this brand new school they should desire to where they could provide maybe a library for the community so could be a dual use could be used for the students and it could also be you used for residents that live in the area you know with with our technology that there there's wait for it to be secure so that way we can make sure that someone that shouldn't be in the school won't go into the school but if they need a library in there in the community they still should be allowed to come to the library at the score that way it would be a child's tea and the city of houston that are partnering in in providing a library not only for the school board for the community so that's something i have mentioned to one of the trustees to see if i get their support another and other situations that for high school they gonna do the same thing at four high schools tear it down and build a new school in that community i've been told they're wanting a community room as they don't have a place for their civic club to me you know they need it church and then the immediate this other place and they always moving around and they can smear be nice if we could have a community room so i brought that up the trustee in that area as well saying well if your gonna rebuild for high school is a possibility can do a community room so therefore in the evenings a community can actually going have their meetings there at the school those are partnerships i like to work with with the hst trustees and it was a child's day running almost running out of time but we have a couple more questions like for you in this age of technology with iphones and androids the way we consumer information in the way that we really function in life is very dependent on technology and it's really changed how we how do we work day today in the past few years we've started that apps for the parking meters what are other ways that we can incorporate technology both in how we communicate with houstonians but also how we live our our day-to-day within the city will in november well first of all when think the legal women voters for the opportunity of being here this evening again i can't remember gallegos completing my first term i was born and raised and it lived in the district all my life i've been an active community activist for thirty-some years i was president my civic club for 15 years houston country club place i was the founder and first president of the east woodlawn dr super neighborhood chair of the route this cage education alliance i was active in the overpass or underpass situation regarding harrisburg so i've been active in the community as a councilmember i've been working hard for the district this is something i'm not taken lightly we were talking about technology invites to go on my face my facebook page i'm always getting compliments on the amount of work that i'm doing in the community and again it's because i'm not taking it lightly i was able to address the guys were them issue has been an issue that we've had in our community for years i was able to talk to the houston got association they're going to raise fifteen million dollars of private investment to renovate that historic us where the golf course i talk to and and and agreed with the houston botanic garden they're going on to claim broke off course i raising over forty million dollars to to redevelop the that green space at these are green spaces are still city property something that's going to bring in economic development i was also able to address issues that we've had regarding stray dogs emancipate came in from austin three-pronged approach where it's education enforcement and providing low-cost spaying and neutering and it meant that is doing that at ripley house with barry 48 the gooseneck mobile clinic so these are things that i have addressed within my first year and eight months i'm looking forward to going back to city hall and working hard for a district with your help i can do that thank you
