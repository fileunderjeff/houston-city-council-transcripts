gonna jump right in with the first question yes with oil prices well below $60 a barrel many houstonians are at risk for losing their jobs in thousands already have what policies and programs should be in place to protect our city's economy will we should do is in regards to you had mentioned he's a community college for example i know that there have been some unemployment regarding the the low price of oil it's been mentioned in the news been mentioned the paper using community college course offers programs you work hard situation to learn other skills and in education and what have you and i think that's something that we need to work with with our hse trustees so that is something that i would work with also regarding the the the revitalization that's going on in our neighborhoods it's also important to work with our chamber of commerce also dcu it what they can do to also that to help hoping that this will be a long trend you know they'll be this is jim temporary trained in regards to the the price of oil as you know city of houston even though it's not the way it used to be back in the eighties where we were basically held hostage in regards to the price of oil i don't personally those can be as bad but yes it's going to affect the city revenue that we take in an economic powerhouse you know we despite some of the sharks happening with the economy right now in the energy industry we're still seeing quite a bit of growth however much of the economic development is actually occurring outside of our city limits for example acts on moving their campus out to the woodlands and now co-champions heading out to sugarland what can we do to really promote business growth inside our city limits well that's where we come in regards to city council we try to provide some incentives for businesses to stay within the city limits you know i'm in when you say that there's a lot of growth going on on the outside i mean i i my district does cover downtown and it's amazing the number of cranes that are in the downtown area in the number of buildings are going up not just in the downtown area mean you look towards the galleria area there's a lot of creams out there as well and also in the medical center so there is a lot of construction going on within the city of houston but yes i do have to agree that we had to do what we have to do regarding providing some incentives so that way businesses if for some reason they're looking at possibly going outside of the city she said that they will stay in the city but i i guess i i destroys it there is a lot of growth there is a lot of things going on within the city of houston downtown medical center in galleria area and you know i i just think that we're doing what we can to to keep the businesses here in the city and again i think some incentives to to make sure that they do state especially now with the price of oil that's something that i think we have to look further to try to make sure that we keep specialties energy companies within the city so houston's a large city as we know with various levels of economy and economic levels for our historians according to the pew research center houston leads that country and economic segregation with the affluent more likely to live among the affluent and the poor more likely to live with the poor with fewer houston neighborhoods hosting middle-class households furthermore professor kleinberg has referred to residential economic segregation as one of our greatest challenges in houston what role in the city of houston play in ensuring that there are thriving mixed-income middle-class and low-income neighborhoods in houston well basically to three weeks ago we held a community meeting what we promoted it with in my district where we had and creative leaders they came to this meeting we had representatives from different departments of the city of houston for example there there's neighborhoods out there that don't have these restrictions as you know we're not sound so if your neighborhood does not have these restrictions then there's a possibility that you even have businesses come into your neighborhood businesses that you meet wish that weren't in your neighborhood and there's really nothing can be done unless their restrictions so we had this meeting two representatives and neighbor neighborhoods that had restrictions but they still had questions we had representatives from the different departments there to answer those questions we had neighborhoods that had they would meet on a monthly basis but yet they didn't have restrictions but they were somewhat organized and we were trying to encourage them to you no further get further information from these different departments so there there there's there's neighborhoods out there that are that that are excited that one to organize our neighborhoods they just don't have a way of doing it and we're going to be having a follow-up meeting i believe we agreed to build sometime in march so that way they come back and get other questions answered and will continue to it to have this one's a council member to try to organize these neighborhoods that's one way of protecting the neighborhoods is by being organizing hopefully having some restrictions in place with the city of economic questions and now like to turn a little bit to quality of life as we know that it's important to consider quality of life if we are to become the world class city that we are poised to become if we aren't already so what are three primary quality of life indicators that you would use a symmetric to develop policies policy around and server constituents what quality life first of all i you know i i support the the bayou greenways project 2020 they were there looking at doing the hike and bike trails throughout the the bayous and city of houston that's something that i i do support i have most of the major buys that run through district i so wyd support that another quality of life issue that i'm working on industry tie is we have issues with stray dogs in our district and i just industry diapers or other districts that are having this issue as well and you can air quality life when you walk outside to exercise to go around the block did your having to carry this big stick with you in fear that they'll be a loose dog in the street that would just come at you so that's something that i have been addressing so that's something that that i'm proud of as well i've also been working with the parks department to provide more green spaces at the parts regards to it and and recreational activities as well so i've been working on that that as well recording quality of life switching gears a bit unfunded pension liability is a major issue for the city of houston what are your ideas about how to address scurried pension issues and how to prevent similar situations from happening again in the future well as you know the pension is controlled from the state legislature so i first of all i feel that the city is obligated to honor the contract we have in place for our current employees but there is an issue that we do have believers 3.2 billion dollars or something that we have outstanding there what we're looking at in the course will be with the new administration is to see how we can address that in what's been discussed since i've been accounted member and that i've been hearing is the possibility of setting something to wear from a certain time frame on new hire ease would be under a different system but the ones that had this contract we would still on it this contract in hand and i strongly feel that we're obligated to honor a contract that we we we've made with with with with the for example the fire department so those current employees would honor that contract but i believe that from a certain time on it would be under a different system regards to retirement pension and but again its control to austin i understand from listen to some of the mayoral candidates what they would like to do courses to get other cities are having issues like this where we could be a combined force to go to the legislature in two years and tried to get it waits to where it will be handled through the municipalities not asked so that's something that i would support as well and the city's largest houston building and maintaining infrastructure of course the challenge you hear over and over again and these elections about potholes goes beyond that of course so how do you think this the city should tackle its infrastructure issues and how do we pay for it regarding the photos you're beyond so goes beyond what i mean i support rebuild houston addresses the potholes dresses drainage you know reconstruction and streets the issue is that we still have bonsai were trying to pay off i understand that by 2018 we were paid most of those bonds off so therefore from that time on you'll start seeing a lot more infrastructure improvements to the fact that we will be pain as we go which is rebuilt euston i know there's during his mayoral campaigns erases you have so far the most seem to be in favor of you have a few that are not in favor of eastern but i do support rebuild he said i think it's a great great program again we're paying off our debt our bonds now by 2018 most of those bonds will be paid off and therefore we will be able to start paying for projects as we go in there for you see a lot more infrastructure improvements within the city of houston houston equal rights ordinance has been quite the topic of debate this year in our city do you support it night i do support it i did vote for it in support of it the reason why i voted for it is that it protects 15 carries characteristics for example it protects minorities hispanics if you're african-american eurasian protects females at the workplace it protects people they're just a disability are brothers disabled it protects the military protects people age discrimination and that's the reason why i support it i know that there's misinformation out there that this is a bathroom ordinance has nothing to do with the bathroom this is a discrimination ordinance illegal has been illegal for someone to go in the restroom to cause harm it's illegal now and it will be illegal if this ordinance passes so for people to be putting that information out there is misleading the public sphere tactics and and and again i did support hero hero protects fitting characteristics in invites to get i would vote for it again in regards to supporting it i get i have a brother thats disabled his guardian gone to a restaurant with my brother to take him to a restaurant you know when feeding him sometimes he slobbers little bit i have to clean his mouth whenever i was at a restaurant time there was a couple at the table next to us i guess they thought their comfortable they got up and they moved to the other side of the restaurant you know it could have happened where the manager said you know and each other you know and have evidence if i wanted to do something about that and i would have to have hired a lawyer and gone through the federal process with hero in place i could just go to city hall involve the discrimination charges that mean we were told to leave the restaurant you know if that would have happened in the city would have investigated instead of hiring an attorney in going to the fair process so again that's why i think he wrote something that would be good for the city of houston there's over 200 cities that had this ordinance in place and no one complained that a man went into a woman's restroom do some harm to an individual so again that's misleading information and i wish they would stop doing that because that's not helping the city of houston throughout the country like ferguson and what happened to maryland how can we improve law enforcement relationships with communities of color in the glbt community well as having community meetings i know our police chief is is out there i had a community meeting basically just to give an update industry dial know what was going on in district i invited the sheaf i was pleasantly surprised to see that he was there at eight o'clock on a saturday morning and to give an update on what the hdd's doing in the community and i've seen him and other events as well similar forums so that's very important is very speedy to be involved in the community to give updates as to what they're doing to address issues of concern and i think hpd is doing an outstanding job in indian bring that information out to the public it has been recently communicated that term limits will be placed on the ballot as an incumbent and someone that has been in city council and running again for another term what is your position on term limits and are you currently in favor of the three-term limit of two years each or do you favor the alternatives to term limit of four years each or do you have an entirely different approach and why well i favored the two four-year terms right now we have three two-year terms but i would favor the two four-year terms that would be on the ballot in november and the reason why is and i'm completing my first term i've been in office for a year and nine months instead of being out in my community in my district and working to to you know to do better the community and quality live in public safety issues and what have you i'm having to campaign basically so that's taking me away from my job i not only that the closest city $1,000,000 for to hold an election so we would save money in that respect also with two four-year terms i would you know i a council member of the mayor of the controller would be able to serve there for years and they would be up for re-election so it's not a guarantee that they're going to be there for eight years are still good afternoon after four years and it's the voters will choose if they decide to keep them for another four years or they're out and they elect somebody new so it's not that there's not going to be a term limit it's just it it makes more sense to have two four-year terms instead of three two-year terms and this is an interesting question to ask if in your districts area so houston has really buy brand the inter-district as well as a museum district but many have criticized the city for not doing enough to support small and medium sized arts organizations and independent artists selected again what would you do to ensure that we have a well-rounded thriving arts community why have the theater district in industry died and of course i have various small arts groups also with industry died so i've got both groups you could say whining monies for prefer their organizations and i know that they ended up hiring someone to do research on it regards to other cities and what they are doing and that was presented at the quality of life committee me not too long ago i understand this week i received a phone call that an agreement has been reached he regards that the district and the smaller groups in regards to funding in how they're going to proceed with that hasn't been brought to our attention yet the caller ec they were asking my opinion and i haven't seen anything yet so i'm waiting to see exactly what that is and i but the person who did call me said both sides seem to be ok with it so if that's the case then i would be ok with it as well as enzymes or representative represents both groups industry died but regarding details on that information yet and it was that in reference to the hotel occupancy tax distribution to the theater district and i don't even know that yet they haven't come back to committee will be coming back to quality of life to give us an update on what they've discussed in what they've come to an agreement quality of life yet i believe we do have quality of life committee next week but i'm mistaken i'm not sure it will be presented then but i'm assuming issue so that does more than curious to hear exactly what the agreement is to make sure both sides are okay as to possible funding and again the gentleman that was hired to do this research he provided information as to how denver does it how it landed does it how san francisco does so there's options out there i'm just not sure what's going to be presented at the quality of life as you know houston is growing at a very fast rate with a lot of people moving into our city and many people living in an urban environment where they want to live work and play within a close proximity we've started seeing some bike lanes coming especially in downtown recently what are some other ways that we can continue creating and fostering a pedestrian friendly city wall for example we the protected by claiming that you're referring to the lamar street in that downtown which is industry died it basically will connect eventually the the new buffalo bayou park with discovery green so i was definitely support a protected by klein i would like to see others also constructed with the light rail line now that we now have two new light rail lines eastern red light rail line in the southeast light rail line which both do commented israel also that with with with cycling and we now the city of houston has agreed to do complete streets so when they redo reconstruct infrastructure improvements on streets they also look at the possibility of adding bike lanes and and sidewalks so that way the pedestrian friendly and then invite release it be booked until save when walking or riding their bikes so that's part of the complete streets that we discuss and we've approved so i do completely support complete streets that will help with pedestrian friendly environments no longer 543 talking about street friend and rail now going through different areas of downtown what is your visit vision for transportation and our city for the next two years then and then to the future well unfortunately we voted on in a referendum next few years you got to be four years ago where we are not to build construct or extend light rail lines you know until 2020 25 so that's way now mentor has redesigned their bus network do the fact that we're we're not supposed to be spending any fund monies in extending our building brand new rail lines but as you know our traffic just continues to get worse i personally support him extending rail lines but fortunately i pass so you know i would like to work with metro in with the city of houston to see if somehow they could be may possibly another referendum in the future in the near future to possibly if possible extend rail to the airport at least that way we can have some real 21 airport would be great to have it also to bush intercontinental airport but the closest as you know his hobby so therefore it wouldn't cost as much to extend real 22 hobby but again as we vote on this referendum of years ago there is not supposed to be any extensions or contraction in the light rail into 2025 but my god by 2025 can you imagine what the traffic is going to be insane houston so therefore i'm hoping if something can be worked out where they could be another referendum at least for an extension to the hobby airport and if so i would definitely support something like that recently houston has been ranked the 15th worst major city in terms of income is income inequality what are your plans to bridge the gaps caused by that fact or one thing i'm working on is there is a great organization industry tie is as as txr acts they are volunteers basically they're retired engineers in whatever you wear their their teaching students to stem programs they have a warehouse in edo in they've outgrown their space they're looking for a new location the old rufus cage school 1417 telephone road it has the old historic building and then next to it has like two or three warehouses where tx arex is interested in maybe expanding to those warehouses so they've applied for cdbg funding we're waiting to see if they're going to get the approval for the cdbg funding but if everything works well then they'll use that money to renovate those warehouses which really good is that it's centrally located to a lot of schools you can also get high school year the eastwood academy you have a cap jeremy you have jackson middle school edison middle school and i hope several elementary schools in the area which will all be able to participate going there and learning the stems and i think that's very interesting that's something that will benefit to students to encourage them to hopefully going to science and engineering in in in in that something that i do support you know and hopefully we'll hear something regarding the cdbg funding within the next two or three weeks of everything goes well they'll be renovating those warehouses and moving into those were houses there in the east and let's talk a little bit about downtown included in your district in such an important part of our city what is your vision for downtown after five let's say we often you come downtown and it's not the same as it used to be but still to come downtown a lot of the people who are here working during the day and get into that traffic but you mentioned a little while ago so what do you see as some of the possibilities for a vibrant downtown in the evening and how do we get there well i think downtown has really improved from what from where we were at five years ago you know you know regards to we have major sports venues you know we have made him a park you know we have the the bbva compass stadium we have toyotas dinner theater district in downtown actually has a theater district master plan and then they have seen their their master plan and their vision of what they want to do in the downtown area to you so you can be more pedestrian-friendly like you mentioned earlier that people can feel comfortable walking from 11 side from the word them sooner over to the alley you know and vice versa in in in in in in whatever did the jones hall in then they're also looking at doing something at jones plaza so they can be connected connect everything much better said that these your plans that are that are out there they're working on a and i think that will really encourage people to come to downtown goes to to the symphony here is the editor and to stay downtown enjoy dinner you know go to honor the entertainment venues in downtown also after the teacher is simply me so we're headed in the right direction you know i mean compared to the way it was just five years ago it's much better i again stated earlier there's a lot of cranes in downtown la to residents you know high-rises they're not even hi rights residency and it's it's it's it's really nice to see that their apartments going up to three level apartment buildings that are going up in downtown again you never you see that you know so that that that's all happening in downtown which means it can be more people coming downtown people that are actually living in downtown therefore they'll be riding their bikes will be taking the rail line you know i'll be walking into the district to the sports venues and all that will be happening in downtown and is happening now is known as one of the most diverse cities in our nation and as you can just see from our table here we're good representation of that what do you see as a value in our city's diversity and what would you do to capitalize on this distinction that houston has well i mean as you stated that that they know we can promote being that way the most diverse city now in the united states you know we surpass new york city so that's something that we need to take advantage of you know it it really bothers me when someone says you know he used to be speaking english in the united states here in houston and texas in the united states or whatever houston is a melting by you know we have so many individuals they're here from all over the world and that's something that we should be proud of its something that we should encourage the different cultures you know right now we're celebrating hispanic heritage month in that several different latin american countries are celebrating their independence from spain and and that's something that we should be proud of you know i really irritates me went when someone's upset that we're celebrating mexican independence day or independent from el salvador celebrating their independence or what have you i don't see why you know why should you be upset that somebody's you know proud of their culture their heritage and yet they're here and they're working hard and they're building the city they're both in this state they're built in this country so there's nothing to be ashamed of and they make it sound like you should be ashamed of your culture and that's the case when candidates speak of crime prevention they asked in talk about formula of workshops when in reality that doesn't necessarily get at the underlying groups root cause of crime crime intervention and prevention policies do you support that can get to that will systematically reduce crime well i think community policing former mayor lee brown used to be our police chief and he's the one that introduced community policing and see if he said i'm a big advocate of community policing i think the the the substations in in the neighborhood is very important in very vital it gives a representation regarding need the the residents who live in that area where they feel more comfortable knowing that there is a substation in their community they see the police officers you know at the restaurant in you you know just at the grocery store by chance or what have you they they see them in the community so they feel more comfortable in an interesting crime issues with with with the police officers i know that you know i have the northeast substation the southeast substation south-central have the east and they're all in industry died so i try to do my best to try to make a pit meaning from each of those districts in that's another thing is that the community goes to the spit meetings have a representative from the various civic clubs or neighborhoods they can address any issues they might be having in their community at these pics meetings and the pygmies are very vital and i encourage people to please go to your monthly pit meaning at your substation that cuz there you can hear what's going on regarding if there's crime in the area or unfortunately if you had experienced crime in your neighborhood that's where you can go to try to get it just because if you don't bring it out and let people know that you're having issues or a hbd know you're having issues and how are they supposed to know you know and and this is one way of doing that is attending your monthly meeting and being active in that pic meaning usually you had the captain of the substation that stare at the meaning so what better than having the cattle near substation to say hey we're having problems in my neighborhood what are you going to do to address these problems in my neighborhood in and the captain will of course let later sergeant in the dtd the drt officer and everyone else now that you know there is this issue and that neighborhood let's go ahead and concentrating tried a result that so i encourage people to attend their monthly board meetings had their substations and how can constituents find out when and where these meetings take place with the easiest way is to just call their substation if for example if you live in my district for example if you live in the hobby airport area you would call the southeast substation that would be where your pet me would be held if if you're in the part of the east and you'd call the east and substation you and the other part of the east and in the edo you'd call south central and then if you're in the northeast part of the district would call the northeast substation and they'll give you the the dates and the times but usually again it's 12 month when it's when they meet in again encourage people to attend those many houstonians work in the energy industry and houston as a city depends on this industry for its vitality as well given the fact that oil prices are going down and we've experienced the shock and many layoffs inner-city what role does a city of houston play in diversifying our economy and an add on to that is what can we do to promote new industries that the technology industry or knowledge industries to come into houston was met with the developer this past week myself and councilmember gonzales where the double developers interested in buying some property in near the downtown area and offering the spaces were there not that large where someone can go and they're starting up you know in in technology or other field they can go in and and leased out these small spaces which is much less expensive and then then then leasing out a building or a good sized building what else though the lease are small spaces they'll get started in in in in in their field and their industry and hopefully fournier they will grow in now be new businesses here in the city of houston it's great concept and we're working with this developer to hopefully that that will happen and he's very excited about it you know he feels that this is something that houston needs and i encounter a gonzales agree we were excited about the the presentation that he gave us in we're working to see what we can do to make sure that that does happen so to answer your question is is just helping others that have an idea had a vision of something that they think they can do as a business and we're helping them as a city providing them and space and a low cost though they can hopefully grow their idea and actually become a new business here in the city of houston as we as we diversify our economy and you know you and sami i just discuss how do we ensure what can the city specifically do to ensure that our houstonians have a livable wage that something that we need to work on i know that there's other cities that are possibly looking at increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour in in i know that there's organizations out there that are looking for something like that i haven't had the opportunity to really really sit down in here both sides i'm willing to sit down here both sides i just having that opportunity yet so it's something that i would look into into that might be better at this city or not but again when given the opportunity i'd like to sit down and discuss that you see the minimum wage can be raised in the city of houston if so what would be the best time to do this now with the economy the way it seems to be going i know this is the time to do it or not so the questions that are like to sit down and ask although it will not be on the ballot this november it is clear that conversations around the city's revenue cap may continue to surface in our next term what effect you think positive or negative revenue cap is currently having on our city and what is your stance on whether or not to lift or modify it why i strongly support lifting the revenue can do this fact that i understand that this this this go-round we had previous 46 million dollars we were not able to collect in in regards to the revenue gap so that was monies that we could have used for infrastructure improvement or for providing new play equipment at a park that the community has been asking for you know this is money's that we did not receive in in in in there we keep the revenue cap in place with 226 it's an it's expected 126 million dollar deficit this this coming fiscal year and then with the revenue cap this is going to add to the problems that we may be having in the future to the fact that we won't have that much those monies for infrastructure improvements for our quality of life in the city of another may be more difficult question maybe not but houston has a very strong mayoral system and when i will have a new mayor coming up and after the election in november so it'll be it'll be someone that the city council's now sorry not were accustomed that's what i'm looking for accustomed to collaborating with and given councils somewhat limited power how do you plan to effect change sort of the real reworked council mayoral grouping well like you stated we're going to have a new american january and we do have a strong mayoral form of government so again this is my first term you know i i've i guess he gets a lot to learn that you know you work with your colleagues you know you work with your colleagues you build a trust with your colleagues said that way when there is an issue or concern that needs to be there needs to be a vote on hopefully you've built that trust with your colleagues and you're asking for their support in their help and their vote to get things done within your district or in the city of houston and sometimes you have to go against the mayor's wishes your decisions you know whatever the the situation is at that time in the only way to get the situation resolved to retain key is by voting on whatever that is and of course the majority rules so if you build that in the year and that that that trust with your colleagues hopefully you'll get the majority of the vote in your favor and you get some things done for example that was done with the botanic garden gloom broke when i was when i would i just got elected my first few months was dealing with gusts were the golf course there has been an issue for years in industry ties to what's going to happen to the oldest golf course in the state of texas is cuss word them what's going to happen because for them you had this other group that was one in turn that into a botanic garden so the community with spread to my first three four months was listening to the community i had various different groups and individuals are coming into my office i was willing to listen to both sides and get in and have them give me their vision of what goes where they should be in by far the vast majority said they wanted to wear them saved as a golf course the mayor had made it clear that her preference was at the technique rd goes for them so in that time frame of several months you know working with my colleagues trying to build their trust the day when he came to a vote as two should go somewhere in the remain as a golf course and be renovated about the houston cough association or convert the golf course into a botanic garden that the houston botanic garden board would take over it was unanimous vote even the mayor approved saving guys wear them as a golf course and now we had the he's in golf association that's gonna raise fifteen million dollars a private money to renovate goes for them the houston botanic garden spoke to them met with them convince them to go on over to go broke of course we shouldn't we shouldn't district i also and they're going to convert bloomberg of course into a world-class botanic garden they're going to raise over forty million dollars of private money to renovate that into a world-class botanic garden as a matter of fact this past wednesday of last week the garden bored they had a luncheon at the river oaks country club it was an over flow of people that were there is to see the conceptual plans that were being presented by the design group westgate and everybody was just thrilled and excited what's going to be at glenbrook of course and what's that going to provide not only for district i but for the city of houston earlier in our conversation you mentioned the nonprofit that's working with children in educating them in stem given that the school board understanding that the school board essentially makes the the the rules that we have our school districts is there a role that city council plays in the underperformance and overcrowding in schools of houston schools and if there is a role white without will be well i know that chicago for example they believe the mayor's also somewhat responsible for the chicago in penn school district in houston we have a course are super intense superintendent and we have our hiv trust deeds so we don't have the day-to-day say so as to what's going on at a chinese d but with that said i did meet a nice to speak with my the ajc trustees that are within district i wish there's to cover district nine so i try to work with them to see what we can do for example i know we pass bonds couple of years ago i believe regarding rebuilding our schools and that's something that i have mentioned it at counsel for example milby right now they left at the side of the old school but they tore everything else they own their bill rebuilding that score changed and they want to do the same thing to stephen f austin those two are in the district and i had mentioned that counsel to see you there could be a partnership if they're going to design this brand new school they should desire to where they could provide maybe a library for the community so could be a dual use could be used for the students and it could also be you used for residents that live in the area you know with with our technology that there there's wait for it to be secure so that way we can make sure that someone that shouldn't be in the school won't go into the school but if they need a library in there in the community they still should be allowed to come to the library at the score that way it would be a child's tea and the city of houston that are partnering in in providing a library not only for the school board for the community so that's something i have mentioned to one of the trustees to see if i get their support another and other situations that for high school they gonna do the same thing at four high schools tear it down and build a new school in that community i've been told they're wanting a community room as they don't have a place for their civic club to me you know they need it church and then the immediate this other place and they always moving around and they can smear be nice if we could have a community room so i brought that up the trustee in that area as well saying well if your gonna rebuild for high school is a possibility can do a community room so therefore in the evenings a community can actually going have their meetings there at the school those are partnerships i like to work with with the hst trustees and it was a child's day running almost running out of time but we have a couple more questions like for you we've heard a lot of conversation in recent years about food deserts so essentially a parts of town where communities do not have closing easy access to healthy healthy food or even just a grocery store so i can you talk to us about how you have a plan to address this issue food deserts and district i know this is something that actually i worked on when i was the president of my super neighborhood east woodlawn does super neighborhood this was several years ago i had called a meeting with the civic leaders in the area we had a representative from krogers that came to the the small kroger store that they're in the east and so we met there and we were trying to get to krogers now that you know we would like a prayer for example any signature story in the area of several years ago at that time you know basically we were told after they listen to us that we couldn't sustain the grocery store like a signature krogers you know and and and and that that person was insulting to be told that you can't sustain groceries as its grocery store like this store here in this part of town so let's say they were correct now when i was over ten fifteen years ago things have changed and you you've got a lot of town homes in edo ya life term homes communion in the east and the demographics have changed and continue to change but unfortunately last week i was talking to a developer and he was trying to bring in a krogers and he was towed again it just won't work and i can't see how that's the case when there's some property that's a better bowl right off the gulf freeway but five minutes from downtown as you know all the residents units are being built in downtown indy do in the east and and detailed it just wouldn't work you know when something is wrong because you get heb at gulf gate and that was open 10 years if not longer years ago it's packed is always a lot of people there shopping during the groceries the brain you wal-mart's been open for a year year and a half their own wayside my gosh you know you go there eleven o'clock at night there's a bunch of cars in the parking lot so we can to stay in the grocery store like a senior shoe store closures and then that was the argument a couple of months ago when krogers came two counts ask for an incentive to expand their krogers distribution center councilmember davis was upset councilmember boykins was upset and now you're coming to us saying that you would send it to expand your warehouse but yet we ask you to come into our communities for a nice quality grocery store and you're telling us it just won't work you know i was very insulted know that they're or they're asking for an incentive and i was told at that time that there's a possibility they might be coming in they're looking at property in the edo or the east and so i figured ok we'll bring things have change that last week when i met with this developer he tells me he spoke to krogers incredibly says it just won't work so again we were misled in this age of technology with iphones and androids the way we consumer information in the way that we really function in life is very dependent on technology and it's really changed how we how do we work day today in the past few years we've started that apps for the parking meters what are other ways that we can incorporate technology both in how we communicate with houstonians but also how we live our our day-to-day within the city will for example ara who is responsible for amongst many things the parking meters for the city of houston they have come to speak to me they're in the process of setting up a system where technology where they will be speaking to some owners that own garages within the downtown area and therefore if someone comes to a sports a new car or to the george r brown convention center they can actually get on a nap or their phone and they'll be guided to a garage that has spaces available for parking instead of having someone just drive around and drive around and drive around her keywords best place to park but what i specifically stated when it was brought to our attention that this is what areas looking at doing i want to make sure that these garages that participate in this program with ara with the city of houston that there's going to be some guidelines on the cost of parking in the garage i don't think it would be good for the city to be providing helping them to provide this service of finding customers for their garage but yet they charge $40 $30 to park there should be some kind of guidelines some kind of limits as to how much they can charge so that way when somebody comes to downtown and uses this technology they don't go to a garage or $40 to park here for a couple hours or something you know i need to make sure there's some guidelines to make sure that garages do participate in this program will charge a reasonable great two-part into their garages council member goes that's it turns out you were the only candidate that was a part of the conversation tonight to thank you for your time and i wanna give you a one minute to tell voters why they should earn your vote in november well first of all when think the legal women voters for the opportunity of being here this evening again i can't remember gallegos completing my first term i was born and raised and it lived in the district all my life i've been an active community activist for thirty-some years i was president my civic club for 15 years

situation regarding harrisburg so i've been active in the community as a councilmember i've been working hard for the district this is something i'm not taken lightly we were talking about technology invites to go on my face my facebook page i'm always getting compliments on the amount of work that i'm doing in the community and again it's because i'm not taking it lightly i was able to address the guys were them issue has been an issue that we've had in our community for years i was able to talk to the houston got association they're going to raise fifteen million dollars of private investment to renovate that historic us where the golf course i talk to and and and agreed with the houston botanic garden they're going on to claim broke off course i raising over forty million dollars to to redevelop the that green space at these are green spaces are still city property something that's going to bring in economic development i was also able to address issues that we've had
