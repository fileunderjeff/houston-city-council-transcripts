as you said that it's it's a two major issue facing the city but at the same time there's more moving parts that need to be identified and data collected than people are are talking about it's more than a sound bite it's more complicated and you've got a lot of commitments that have been made by prior administrations that we're trying to honor at the same time we're trying to make it sustainable for those that we will be returning out in the future also we have a lot of new hires so as the new hires come in you know they they were counting on those to help support some of the few you no doubt outcome of the ones that are in the pipeline so we've got a lot of moving parts that have to be considered it's not just a matter of just change the system here that a lot in the campaigns and that's that's where i'm a little uneasy about the conversations i think the public understands that there is an issue and without everyone coming to the table under the current the current structure in a green won't move anywhere so we have to we can't be beating up on our employees at the same time and expect him to come to the table and work with us first of all we should be beating up our employees and in the first place we appreciate all of our employees that all the work they've done they do a fabulous job it's nothing it's nothing personal it's a it's about the making sure that there is retirement there for him in the future so do you then in terms of strategies for addressing the pension issues i do support local control it depends if it'd been under the current administration would've been uncomfortable with it because they did not the current administration does not have a good working relationship with fire for example and if we had local control under the current situation i'm not i would've been confident and comfortable with moving forward with local control now to say that legislature meets again to get that local control at that point depending on who the next mayor is that unfortunately plays into this as well so if they can't work with the next mayor must be able to work with fire police and employee only employees but for the citizens for houstonians for all of us for all of our future so that's fair with oil prices well below $50 a barrel at this time many houstonians are at risk for losing their jobs and in fact many already have despite the fact that houston is a multi-industry town it still does not it does not look good in terms of our energy forecast what policies and programs should be in place to protect the city's economy i love this question think we had this conversation before we started about technology i am i when i hit hit the office the first time i was all about what technology can we add to to the city the fact of the matter is when we had when i read that the city in 2010 i think it was i feel like we're in the nineteen eighties technology is not was not a priority at the city and we we failed on a number of part because what they would do is they get a project and they would get funded to a certain point and when the money ran out than some of the things that the enhancements and things that they could have done with technology was left off and even if it was a disaster recovery plan or whatever it is they got the they got the basic core function going in in the work around and kept moving so now i think there's an opportunity to communicate is as you said to our citizens i know we have a rollout out with the and i have it on my phone right now my iphone the tells you when you can put out george heavy trash or your trash or recycle if you don't have that on your phone today i suggest you go i don't have it i didn't have it handy i didn't know you're gonna ask me that question otherwise would have told everyone where to find it but there is a rollout out so there's so many things that we can do to communicate the budget everything to be transparent can be online available there's no reason for anyone not to have information at the city i my staff does a fabulous job of we have an e-newsletter and it has so much information we have a blast we have so many ways of communicating today with facebook twitter and believe or not even you know my stage in life i'm all about all of that i am very very capable and thankful that i have a staff as well that's
