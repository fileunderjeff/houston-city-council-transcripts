well i i think that there's not a singular fix on the issue number one the single largest cause is that the city has over multiple years determined not to pay what is called the arc or the the asking amount as opposed to what the legal amount we are supposed to pay so that's it's the different sort of like your your basic pledge in your maximum pledged so we've not been paying the maximum pledged to keep up i don't think there'll be a singular fix i think there will be a multiple level level six remember that we have three major pension plans we have the municipal pension plan which is some people indicated about 60% to 70% funded fully funded now i understand that's over a thirty or forty year time period not all of those deaths are due tomorrow we have the police pension fund which is about 75 to 85 percent fully funded and we have the firefighters police pension fund which is by some accounts as much as 95% fully funded remember that the police in the firefighters in their service to the city are not paid social security so this pension matters it really is there only line of retirement benefits to other than what they may have saved in worked for so i think what's gonna have to happen is that as we look towards the issues of bringing back some some levels of local control in relationship to potentially the firefighters pension we know that the the meet and confer has already happened with police and hope i think there were gonna have to look at some combination of things shared costs by employees i think we're gonna have to look at some reduction in future salaries benefits not the current salaries benefits the future hires benefits i think we're going to have to look at some potentials of 401k type programs proposed hopefully on steroids but most importantly what we're gonna need to have and this is where the electorate becomes very important we're gonna have to elect a mayor that's going to be able to sit down with some level of trust of all of those pension programs and say here's where we want to go in and bring the employees along with them without scaring people i think the singular most important thing that we do right now is that we need to have a sober business-like conversation and we need to stop scaring people about the pension liabilities do we have a delicious do we have debt we need to pay yes is it a crisis know is it fixable absolutely i believe we can fix it if we use the houston model just sitting down using common sense in coming to a good program together next question council member as houston continues to grow thank you the next question is about the economy with oil prices below $50 about iran now many houstonians are at risk for losing their jobs in fact many already have policies and programs should be in place from a city perspective and from your position and city council to protect our city's economy well as you know we currently have a rebuild houston program for all basic purposes that was sold to the public as a pay-as-you-go program i think that is a fiscally responsible way to approach the issue the challenge has been with that will have you pay as you go if you pay down debt first so we've been paying down some debt so we've had some we've had some the pain on the front we've not gotten as much construction dollars per dollar per traction foot per dollar on the front end because we've been paying down there as we paid larger sections of that debt more and more dollars will go we will go into the fund to make sure that we have more for construction as we move forward i i generally support the idea of rebuild houston if the court say that we need to put it back before the public will certainly vote to do that i think it is a fiscally prudent approach to not have debt as we move forward with construction as much as possible next question what are the three primary quality of life indicators that you would use as a metric to develop policy around and serve your constituents well first of all i want to give my sincere thanks to the voters of district j for allowing me to serve you for the past four years it's been a great opportunity it's been a great part of my life to be able to serve you and you know better than anyone that the number one task that we have put forward in the district office is community service constituent services everyone if you've called you know that we not we don't simply give you a number and say call this person but we walking down the hall we make the call for you we do the work for you we are your shield and we are your battler or we battle for you down at city hall every day it's been enormously grateful to work with communities to help them vision where they are and understand where they are now and where they want to be it's been exciting to work particularly with the kids engulfed in to help them design their own skate park to help them raise money for that and and is now particularly exciting to be looking at the last two years of the term so i'm asking the citizens to give me my final two years of the three two-year terms to be able to finalize a number of those projects but we're not gonna just stop with the work that we've been doing we're going to look at safety and security along the 59 corridor and how do we continue to clean that up with texts i we're going to look at other neighborhood related issues we're going to look at additional green space and more importantly we're going to look at quality of life issues that matter to your family southwest houston is the future of this city southwest houston is the future of this state and i believe that we have the best people were the most prepared and we're looking forward to be a workforce for the future thank you so much for allowing me to serve you god bless and i hope i can count on your support on election day thank you
