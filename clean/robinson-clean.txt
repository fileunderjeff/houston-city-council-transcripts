well it's it's an important question for the city to face right now and and there's been no shortage of discussion at the horseshoes through the first year and a half of my first term here we're really looking at that in a number of ways but through the budget and fiscal affairs committee of this of the city council and in this case we know that we have three pension funds that of the municipal employees and police officers as well as the firefighters all three of those pensions are important for the reasons you stayed ultimate sustainability within the financial budget of the city and they are however unequal in how they are governed and regulated and i think to get to a position where the city has more fundamental responsibility for how they are operated in particular with the firefighters is a very important issue with legislative control in austin that's something that city council has really been handcuffed with regards to any opportunity to get to the table to meet and confer in a in a positive form i think we do have an excellent relationship with or firefighters who do such important work for us as with the police officers in our municipal employees so we we owe it to our employees and a special especially those who have made promises to to hold our promises as we go forward but to get to a place where we have more sustainable models we need to have a really functional government that works with counsel with our austin delegation of elected officials and in that regard it is of utmost importance that we have open dialogue with all parties so the city can be securing its future as well as our first offenders and important public servants thank you so in this city is largest used in building and maintaining infrastructure is a real challenge true course when candidates speak of crime prevention they often proposed a formula of more cops equals less crime but in reality the systemic causes of crime are linked to issues of education poverty of opportunity what crime intervention and prevention policies do you support the systemic address crime well i am a big believer in public transportation and happy to say that in a day or two from today metro will be unveiling its new re-imagined system network for its bus service which is really the backbone of our system is what we've built on we have absolutely efficient parking right system second to none in the nation and those things are great for those suburban commuters who are trying to get officially into town it's very tempting and worthwhile way to save time in the morning rush hour in the evening to get only get to work in the morning by way of the bus system in and some of those high-speed lanes so expanding on that i do believe is part of the solution i i am a believer that concrete is not always the solution in its own inner modles systems by that we mean the light rail is coming and i think about to really be a marvelous asset for the city of houston and something that we can really celebrate as we come up with final four and the super bowl coming to town in the next few years so there there's exciting things happening but whether it's bus rapid transit like what we see that's going to be taking place on the post oak order in uptown or some of what we're seeing now here in the east and where the harrisburg line and southeast line are accessing some of our universities in a way that i i see all the time i think we need to continue to expand that program with her last few minutes left we do we do when we have time for you to address the voters directly but just quickly with oil prices well below $60 a barrel many houstonians are at risk of losing their jobs and thousands already have this right what policies and programs should be in place to protect our city's economy very good thanks again for this time with you and folks having served for a little over a year and a half now as you're at large city council member i'll tell you that it's it's been a great honor to have a wonderful staff have a great position on the horseshoes serving you at large of six hundred and forty square miles of this wonderful city every neighborhood every great diverse citizen of the great city of houston in this case i feel it's important to emphasize that i've had two distinct appointments want is to be the vice chair of the quality of life committee that has to do direct responsibility and oversight for the department of planning and development parks and recreation department of neighborhoods libraries and the department of health and human services and in addition to that there's a one category that's not a department but it's defined as issues related to culture and international affairs in that regard i am bilingual speak spanish and practice it every day i think in that regard i've had the pleasure of meeting a number of our consular ambassadors and the folks that work with international trade i'm a cheerleader father over cheerleader you did mention that my daughter was at lanier middle school she's actually just finished her freshman year at lemoore high school but she stopped me a little bit about cheerleading and i hope i can be your second term at-large councilmember position number 2
