well i think just to see by the way i i do want to say i think districts he is spectacular and i'm really fortunate to represent them i think districts he has a number of interesting challenges we have the greatest percentage of development residential development so that's one of the first challenges people want to move into districts see and where they're going to move and what is that going to mean in terms of transportation i think that's one of the biggest the other issues of the issues that other people face the infrastructure i roads problems with flooding concern over safety basic quality of life issues and i if i'm not mistaken we also have the highest population of all council members represent about the same number but the last time the numbers are given to me it was closer 215,000 people and it's it's a very interesting district just so it might be that people don't know just taxis so if you don't mind i'll explain a little bit about it starts in meyerland in the south and then it goes down braeswood it goes through rice university through the montrose includes memorial park it goes up to the heights includes timber grove it goes all the way up to to dwell into ninety so it's very serpentine but from the south to the north people care about the same things the same quality of life issues so i think those are the main issues kind of district is looking at it so in line of cases such as sandra bland and michael brown how do we improve relationships between law enforcement and community communities of color here in houston well i wish i knew what to feel better but let me take that second part where most culturally diverse city in the united states that says a great deal that really does what it says to me is that people understand equal rights as well equal rights this is not a glbt issues this is an equal rights issue and one of the examples are use is if i was with a friend who was let's say my age and i'm a little more senior than either of you and i went to the new chic restaurant in town and i was told at the door although i could see other tables that they just didn't have room for the two of us it was clear to me as the young people walked in that there was room where do i go to who who do i turn ti until this until we have the full rights ordinance in place i have to hire a private lawyer i have to go through the federal court system once this is in place i can go to inspector general and it may turn out that the manager the owner of the restaurant didn't know what the manager is doing i know i don't shut down a restaurant i just want to see my friend and i want to be able to go into your restaurant and the veteran needs to be undergone the restaurant and the pregnant woman needs to be able to go on the restaurant and the people of color need to go on there's 15 identities that need to be protected that's what the equal rights ordinance is about so i have confidence in the city of houston and its people i really do that they're going to vote for equal rights for all and i'll tell you if you have any question i brought my show and tell if you haven't read lisa falkenberg column it is absolutely spectacular and debunks the bathroom myth and talks about equal rights and that's what it's about it it really is i gonna do the right thing yes yes it will i really believe so and funded pension liability as a manager for the city of houston what are your ideas about how to address current pension issues and how to prevent similar situations in the future well as you know it's it's on the ballot now we presently served three two-year terms the ballot is going to have to four-year terms i personally i think that two four-year terms as a reasonable way to go i really do and it's not just me i have 72 civic clubs in my district 72 the next closest ones or maybe thirty civic loans 2572 and when i'm out talking to civic clubs i sort of do a bit of a straw poll and i say to them let me ask you just not or you know your thumbs up how do you feel most of the people in districts see that i've talked to in the civic clubs have said that they think two four-year terms of the way to go in our research so that most big cities have four-year terms if they have term limits have four-year terms rather than the two years two years it costs a lot of money every time we put our election it cost the city a lot of money so i i think two four-year terms of the way to go and how do you feel we could better use technology in order to communicate with our citizens here in houston so you think there's a problem with the infrastructure really that's a pretty mean potholes those kind kind of thing you know an end alright so let's pull it down the district see because districts he has a tremendous number of people that can travel through district see so we have in fact i was able to garner with the cip project 22% of the cip money for just a sec and for infrastructure we got to where we are today because we didn't do what we needed to do previously in fact not all that long ago and there was a problem with the water main in district see and they pulled up the pipe it was wooden wooden water pipe so you know it's been some time since they were able to to do anything i think i think the system we have right now works i think that rebuild houston is the way to go i know there's some frustration on the part of some people if thinking it's not going fast enough i don't think we should go back into debt to pay for that so i think it should be as the money comes in we pay as you pay as you go and we take care of the issues that come up but infrastructure is a huge problem in some ways you know the truth vs help with that they pick up some of the projects that we want on and we become a partner with the city and so that turns as will pay for part of it in my case we've got issues going on on westheimer that we've taken care of just about right now i've got the worker beaters i've got the midtown tours and if they pay for some of that in the city doesn't have to and that money can stay in the city coffers so councillor colin do you what are your views in terms of raising the minimum wage for public and private employees now i support raising the minimum wage i think i mentioned that i think couple of questions ago we have to have a living wage for employees we can't be a city two separate groups we we have some wonderful wonderful companies here that are very respectful of their employees others that are not such good partners and not only the minimum wage hbu raised but we have to make sure that the companies are paying their employees subcontractors are doing what they're supposed to do and and and making sure that people can raise their children and their families with dignity to schools that they're that they want to send them to be clothed and fed and housed i mean that's what we're about not just used to love this country they were battling for so he went to give you the last word so if you would like to address the city of houston as to why you should be the next council member of rotisserie
