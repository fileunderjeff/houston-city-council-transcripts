yes that's actually a great question and relates a lot in large part to our campaign for city council the the motto of our campaign really relates to moving all of houston forward and that's in large part because there are several different aspects of the city and some of which are are succeeding in very successful in terms of opportunity economic growth but others of which seem to be being left behind i think it's a it's critical that we focus on providing opportunities and austin also opportunities for training for people in terms of our workforce opportunities for sustainability as it relates to education but also as it relates to jobs that are available in on the market we also need to be cultivating small business opportunities as well and so there's a variety of fronts that we think that we need to look at in connection with actually providing opportunities for families and individuals to be more sustainable to bridge that gap in terms of that disconnect between sustainability and those that are not so used to gonna move into one of our ballot initiatives absolutist fall decor i thought i have a two part question for the first part is how you vote on the e houston legal rights or events based on what the supreme court of texas supreme court is set where i'm you would either vote yes for the ordinance or no against audit so one how will you vote in the second part is why are you voting that way absolutely i think you always look at questions that relate to job creation in terms of opportunities for economic development so look at job creation but you also look at in terms of communities how we promoting a healthier lifestyle for people so we ask that that relates to access to green waste for example and sometimes it might be a very simple issues like not having streetlights which then people from actually accessing the park said they might have in their neighborhoods and then finally we want to make sure that we're looking at the question as to whether or not it's the most effective way to achieve the goals so when you thinking about a lot of the conversations about complete streets and in conversations relating to things of that nature in terms of what neighborhoods want again you want to focus on those policy areas that would make you put you in a better position so that you're making it more convenient for the residents to actually want to be in that destination if elected city council member you will represent all of the people in houston how will you ensure that you are representing all of his stuff all houstonians yes i think it's critical that you keep an open line of communication and when you have an open line of communication truly listened when you actually are opening that lineup i think leadership is all about listening and taking it in in in informing yourself and so for me not to listen means that i'm not trippin myself with the ability to actually be an informed decision maker at the table so that's first and foremost is to keep that line of communication open always listen and keep an open door policy make people feel welcome in terms of their feedback there they may have they may have an expertise area that you may not be familiar equip yourself with the knowledge so you can be in a position to make really good decisions for the city and that is kinda encompassing about the houston the incident in in the city alright well we want to give you the last word ok so why don't you talk to the voters of the city of houston and tell them why they should let them at edwards for houston city council at-large position for
