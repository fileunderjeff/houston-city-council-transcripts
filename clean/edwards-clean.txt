we'll jump right into the questions that our first question this youth in the rain the 15th worth major city when it comes to income inequality and what are your plans to bridge that gap caused by that fact yes that's actually a great question and relates a lot in large part to our campaign for city council the the motto of our campaign really relates to moving all of houston forward and that's in large part because there are several different aspects of the city and some of which are are succeeding in very successful in terms of opportunity economic growth but others of which seem to be being left behind i think it's a it's critical that we focus on providing opportunities and austin also opportunities for training for people in terms of our workforce opportunities for sustainability as it relates to education but also as it relates to jobs that are available in on the market we also need to be cultivating small business opportunities as well and so there's a variety of fronts that we think that we need to look at in connection with actually providing opportunities for families and individuals to be more sustainable to bridge that gap in terms of that disconnect between sustainability and those that are not so used to have a very strong mayoral system for the city charter yes and city council members really don't have a lot of power that is delegated to them by that document so given those limitations how will you affect change as a city council member i think it's critical that you first as a city council be able to have visions so i want to come to city council in bringing that conversation to the forefront at terms of the vision for where we want to go and that way it creates an environment where you can then be strategic about policies that will drive you in that direction wherever you decided you want to be as a city i think it's important when you have sixteen people around a horseshoe that you have a very collaborative work style and that is in fact what is my experience in so i'm very familiar with working with people you've got to have a humbled leadership style as well in order to get sixteen people around the table 2 to move forward and that's what i'm committed to doing in council so although it is a very strong mayor form of government i think that if you're collaborative in your mind is focused on vision for your city's future you can move forward and could do that collectively gonna move into one of our ballot initiatives absolutist fall decor i thought i have a two part question for the first part is how you vote on the e houston legal rights or events based on what the supreme court of texas supreme court is set where i'm you would either vote yes for the ordinance or no against audit so one how will you vote in the second part is why are you voting that way ok absolutely to the answer your first part i would vote yes in favor of hero the houston equal rights ordinance and end the reason why i think it's very important that the city of houston does not discriminate or have the appearance of allowing discrimination to occur i think that's important for us to make sure that we are embracing all of our residents and making sure the laws and protections for all of our residents are properly extended so i would definitely vote in favor of europe so every city council member has different things they look for when they're making decision what are three quality of life indicators that you're always gonna look at when you make a decision of how to vote on used to city council absolutely i think you always look at questions that relate to job creation in terms of opportunities for economic development so look at job creation but you also look at in terms of communities how we promoting a healthier lifestyle for people so we ask that that relates to access to green waste for example and sometimes it might be a very simple issues like not having streetlights which then people from actually accessing the park said they might have in their neighborhoods and then finally we want to make sure that we're looking at the question as to whether or not it's the most effective way to achieve the goals so when you thinking about a lot of the conversations about complete streets and in conversations relating to things of that nature in terms of what neighborhoods want again you want to focus on those policy areas that would make you put you in a better position so that you're making it more convenient for the residents to actually want to be in that destination if elected city council member you will represent all of the people in houston how will you ensure that you are representing all of his stuff all houstonians yes i think it's critical that you keep an open line of communication and when you have an open line of communication truly listened when you actually are opening that lineup i think leadership is all about listening and taking it in in in informing yourself and so for me not to listen means that i'm not trippin myself with the ability to actually be an informed decision maker at the table so that's first and foremost is to keep that line of communication open always listen and keep an open door policy make people feel welcome in terms of their feedback there they may have they may have an expertise area that you may not be familiar equip yourself with the knowledge so you can be in a position to make really good decisions for the city and that is kinda encompassing about the houston the incident in in the city so one of houston's big public health problems is obesity and it's a problem that greatly exacerbated by food deserts so what can you do is a city council member and what can the city do to increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables and other foods that can lead to more healthy lifestyle yes great question in fact i've spent quite a bit of time on that issue with the houston area urban league i led an initiative to take them in their exact question in terms of childhood obesity in again food deserts relate to childhood obesity because people don't have access to fresh produce and fresh foods that are affordable one of the things that i have done prior to my time now running for office working with an organization called project row houses with trying to bring a cooler co-op into the third ward eerie and we've done that another thing that we have to do while if i'm elected on city council is look for opportunities to create incentives for fresh produce our vendors for fresh produce to be located in through deserts i think that's important you hear a lot about people talking about incentives for a variety of things but very little is said about incentives for those type of first those type of needs in our community and that's what we need to be encouraging and it's in a buzzing with our policy so i definitely would be committed to that alright well we want to give you the last word ok so why don't you talk to the voters of the city of houston and tell them why they should let them at edwards for houston city council at-large position for thank you thank you again for having me i'm running for houston city council at-large position for because i and wanting i want to be a part of long-term change in the city of houston i think it's critical that you have someone at the table who

a position to be able to do that so i ask for your support amanda edwards for houston city council at-large position for thank you
