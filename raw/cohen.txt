going to dive right in their first question what do you think are the biggest issues facing District C

well I think just to see by the way I i do want to say I think districts he is spectacular and I'm really fortunate to represent them I think districts he has a number of interesting challenges we have the greatest percentage of development residential development so that's one of the first challenges people want to move into districts see and where they're going to move and what is that going to mean in terms of transportation I think that's one of the biggest the other issues of the issues that other people face the infrastructure I roads problems with flooding concern over safety basic quality of life issues and I if I'm not mistaken we also have the highest population of all council members represent about the same number but the last time the numbers are given to me it was closer 215,000 people and it's it's a very interesting district just so it might be that people don't know just taxis so if you don't mind I'll explain a little bit about it starts in Meyerland in the south and then it goes down Braeswood it goes through Rice University through the Montrose includes Memorial Park it goes up to the heights includes timber Grove it goes all the way up to to dwell into ninety so it's very serpentine but from the south to the north people care about the same things the same quality of life issues so I think those are the main issues kind of district is looking at it

and actually speaking of quality of life what would you consider to be the three quality of life indicators that you would use to formulate policy and serve your constituents 

well I think in general is you know how how are they responding to you know when they open their front door when they walk out almost to the point that we're just talking about before can I walk out safely that's a quality of life issue that's a big one do they feel comfortable you know walking in the evening around their neighborhood that's a quality of life issue again what about about the roads you know can they can they maneuver them comfortably there are places and districts see that have sidewalks that are in good shape there's some that aren't in such good shape and said he doesn't know doesn't man doesn't take care of the sidewalks but the point being that if you don't have sidewalks are you can't walk comfortably on your side Walker push a stroller or ride a bike or in a wheelchair can you go on industry can you manage to maneuver along manner and other quality of life issues what's the condition of the neighborhood is the trash and refuse picked up properly these are the types of issues that people you know it's it's interesting to digress just for a minute but Wednesday kleinberg did his study as he does every year he talked a number of years ago two young couples and ask them you know where would you like to live and most of them we want to live out we want a big yard one big backyard want lots of space he's asked that question more recently and the footprint has changed completely they want to live much closer in they don't care that much about about they want to be able to walk to a grocery store they want to be able to they want their children to be able to go to a school around the corner so that's that's the quality of life that I'm hopefully can help my constituents maintained and with the addition of the bike lanes downtown recently as an example what else can we do to continue to build pedestrian-friendly possession or biker friendly commuting options within the city welcome unit if you talk about commuting options and you talk about transportation in general reserve a bike lanes I think are excellent but if they're not competing with the with the cars on the road you know an awful or if they can be returned safely and not competing with light rail and are careful about where they're riding biking is is really critical and we're doing so much now to have a connectivity between all the deberias bypass but if you're talking about commuting you talking about getting around to tell you about buses light rail commuter commuter rail we have to have an integrated transportation system we can't be the fourth largest city in the united states and not be able to get from point A to point be comfortably it's great that we have a life rail but when you get off the train and it's 97 degrees it's really difficult to walk 10 blocks to your place of business so is there a bus that's going to be a bit take you from the train to block within your business these are the kinds of things were looking at and how do we get people from the outlying areas India system i mean it's this is really critical I'm a big proponent of light wear on retirement so which is in the district so I hope that comes through

so in line of cases such as Sandra bland and Michael Brown how do we improve relationships between law enforcement and community communities of color here in Houston 

well I think I think we do have a reasonably good relationships I really do you know we have an african-american chief of police and obviously his sensitivity is clearly there I mean you get it when you hear him speak but we have to have training we have to have culturally sensitive training we have to have our police officers become part of the community we need we need more of the neighbourhood policing mean if you know if your police officer and you'll know who lives in the area that you are protecting you have a much greater sense of view of the people as your your neighbors and you're much more inclined to treat each other with dignity and respect and I think that I think that's the issue I really do and of course I guess we're talking safety per minute I just wanted to address again for one second I mean we we need more we need more police on the streets and we need police more cadet classes to do that and in the classes that's where the training can take place as well

absolutely we mentioned in your introduction that you have championed the Houston equal rights ordinance since we know that question a little bit differently maybe I can you explain to the viewers why you are supporting the ordinance and what what we can expect in November 

well I wish I knew what to feel better but let me take that second part where most culturally diverse city in the united states that says a great deal that really does what it says to me is that people understand equal rights as well equal rights this is not a GLBT issues this is an equal rights issue and one of the examples are use is if I was with a friend who was let's say my age and I'm a little more senior than either of you and I went to the new chic restaurant in town and I was told at the door although I could see other tables that they just didn't have room for the two of us it was clear to me as the young people walked in that there was room where do I go to who who do I turn ti until this until we have the full rights ordinance in place I have to hire a private lawyer I have to go through the federal court system once this is in place I can go to inspector general and it may turn out that the manager the owner of the restaurant didn't know what the manager is doing I know I don't shut down a restaurant i just want to see my friend and I want to be able to go into your restaurant and the veteran needs to be undergone the restaurant and the pregnant woman needs to be able to go on the restaurant and the people of color need to go on there's 15 identities that need to be protected that's what the equal rights ordinance is about so I have confidence in the city of Houston and its people I really do that they're going to vote for equal rights for all and I'll tell you if you have any question I brought my show and tell if you haven't read Lisa Falkenberg column it is absolutely spectacular and debunks the bathroom myth and talks about equal rights and that's what it's about it it really is I gonna do the right thing yes yes it will I really believe so 

what policies and programs do you feel should be in place in order to protect our city's economy

while the policies and programs have to be in place i think im much what we have right now I think we are attracting businesses to houston we've got over 3,000 people among you know we've got we have a reasonable tax base very reasonable we know his tunes going the way it is because we are doing the right things I think we have to make sure we're education system our public school education system is in place and something that we're proud of my both my children graduated from public school when you're trying to attract companies to come to use they want to know what your educational system looks like that's terribly important but we have so many other things to do we have a spectacular Medical Center you know we have the poor women have so many things in Houston offers that if I was looking to relocate my company's someone would be front and center really would be so I think we're doing the right things now 

and funded pension liability as a manager for the City of Houston what are your ideas about how to address current pension issues and how to prevent similar situations in the future

well clearly pensions issue is a big issue front and center and I've had the opportunity to work with firefighters with the police with municipal employees and I want to say off the bat that I mean these are really good people these are people that are doing what they're doing for the right reasons they're protecting us they're making our lives more comfortable in the need to be paid a living reasonable wage something that encourages them that said they're not interested in seeing the city of Houston shutdown of attention you know that don't want that because then they're gonna lose jobs that's not what we want to go at all so much my way of looking at it is that having spent two sessions in Austin Austin needs to get out of the pension business Houston has to be able to take responsibility for our decisions that were gonna make in terms of working with the with the three groups I think I can I think we can make it work I think we need to put a lot of things on the table and have a discussion over the over defined benefit over a defined contribution talk about it you know what are we going to do because if we look at our rearview mirror we see Detroit so we want to look ahead and buy looking ahead we've gotta come up with a system that will say this city council right now that's in place is a very fiscally conservative city council it really is and I think there is no interest in kicking the can down the road I'm sorry to use it hackneyed expression but I really think there is a strong sense of wanting to come up with a solution and i think im both sides 

and speaking of city council how do you feel about term limits in Deerfield at that particular system needs to be reformed or changed in any way

well as you know it's it's on the ballot now we presently served three two-year terms the ballot is going to have to four-year terms I personally I think that two four-year terms as a reasonable way to go I really do and it's not just me I have 72 civic clubs in my district 72 the next closest ones or maybe thirty civic loans 2572 and when I'm out talking to civic clubs I sort of do a bit of a straw poll and I say to them let me ask you just not or you know your thumbs up how do you feel most of the people in districts see that i've talked to in the civic clubs have said that they think two four-year terms of the way to go in our research so that most big cities have four-year terms if they have term limits have four-year terms rather than the two years two years it costs a lot of money every time we put our election it cost the city a lot of money so I i think two four-year terms of the way to go 

as you know Houston has a very strong mayoral system and council members have limited power how do you plan to effect change if you were to go into your third term with this limitation well

I know we have the strongest form of mayor of government in the country and I on a personal level of enjoyed working for mayor I found her to be open accessible not necessarily agreeing with me everything so while it is a strong from government I do feel that she and whoever our future mayors will be reasonable in terms of issues that we want to bring up I i really think that it might be advantageous to have some way of trying to get something under the agenda I'm not in favor of what was proposed recently but what it boils down to is that we only vote on something that's on the agenda and how do you get it on the agenda so I think there are ways to talk about possibly being able to get something in there is now but it involves adding its 12 members I'm just not sure but I think there is reasonable ways of getting a message on you know to get it on the agenda if it's not even talking about something that's so obscure I think there would be open to a discussion 

and how do you feel we could better use technology in order to communicate with our citizens here in Houston

well I think there's a variety of ways the city has a wonderful website ok really does it actually works and it in I am NOT technologically skilled can get through it and can figure it out so that's good thing the citizens need to know that we do have a really good system but here's the issue what about people who don't have computers what about seniors or people with some form of disability who can't quite comfortable working computers so how do we get messages out to them how do we communicate concerns one of the things we have as we have pretty good library system accessible to people so that I think it would be very advantageous as if the libraries were set so that seniors could go in there people would help them in terms of how it worked at computers maybe a large-screen computer maybe even skyping opportunities maybe during a council meeting people sitting there could actually observe what's going on at a council meeting maybe there could be some form of interactive communication and if that a library than some of the senior centers those type of things and i think that and and and finally a thinker 311 system needs to be improved and there are some issues with that when you call 311 and they give you a tracing number it doesn't necessarily give you the answers you need and you may get a note that says your issue has been dealt with what all that means is may have been sent to a particular department I think would be helpful in terms of communication if I would get on my computer something that says this is where it stands this is what's happened recently something that would update me so those are just some suggestions and communication 

in the city as large as Houston building and maintaining infrastructure is obviously a challenge how do you think the city can tackle its infrastructure issues and how do we pay for it

so you think there's a problem with the infrastructure really that's a pretty mean potholes those kind kind of thing you know an end alright so let's pull it down the district see because districts he has a tremendous number of people that can travel through district see so we have in fact I was able to garner with the CIP project 22% of the CIP money for just a sec and for infrastructure we got to where we are today because we didn't do what we needed to do previously in fact not all that long ago and there was a problem with the water main in district see and they pulled up the pipe it was wooden wooden water pipe so you know it's been some time since they were able to to do anything I think I think the system we have right now works I think that rebuild houston is the way to go I know there's some frustration on the part of some people if thinking it's not going fast enough I don't think we should go back into debt to pay for that so I think it should be as the money comes in we pay as you pay as you go and we take care of the issues that come up but infrastructure is a huge problem in some ways you know the truth vs help with that they pick up some of the projects that we want on and we become a partner with the city and so that turns as will pay for part of it in my case we've got issues going on on Westheimer that we've taken care of just about right now I've got the worker beaters I've got the Midtown tours and if they pay for some of that in the city doesn't have to and that money can stay in the city coffers so councillor Colin do you what are your views in terms of raising the minimum wage for public and private employees now I support raising the minimum wage I think I mentioned that I think couple of questions ago we have to have a living wage for employees we can't be a city two separate groups we we have some wonderful wonderful companies here that are very respectful of their employees others that are not such good partners and not only the minimum wage HBU raised but we have to make sure that the companies are paying their employees subcontractors are doing what they're supposed to do and and and making sure that people can raise their children and their families with dignity to schools that they're that they want to send them to be clothed and fed and housed I mean that's what we're about not just used to love this country they were battling for 

for the next question so we've been talking about the economy obviously in Houston and you mentioned attracting companies to the city recently we've seen a lot of major corporations choose to go outside the city limits for example tax on campus Montgomery County so what can we do to bring these businesses into our business owners here within the city 

well I mean exxon was in the city and you know they needed to enlarge our campus and I don't know all the things that they were offered but it was obviously attractive but there's still a great opportunity to bring doesn't says to Houston and I think as I mentioned I think that a lot of tax rate that we offer is very attractive I think the city can do some deals with companies that say listen you know will help you if you help us I think that we have to make sure that we do have integrated transportation because that's what people looking for they're going to move people here we have to pass the Equal Rights Ordinance so that no company turns around and says I'm not gonna take my my employees to Houston they don't have an equal rights ordinance and you know if you got to that subject I was going to bring it around again find you know really that that is true I mean I honestly have heard that you know of companies thinking of moving look at quality of life issues Inc all rights ordinance is clearly if companies themselves have strong equal rights programs within the company's they're not gonna move somewhere that jeopardizes their employees and the employees are going to turn around and say listen to every other big city every other city of any size the United States as an equal rights or notes and you know that's very important to them and we jeopardize among other things I am you know this is not a scare tactic one but we know that if the Equal Rights Ordinance doesn't pass the Super Bowls gonna take a second look at us as they did in in Phoenix so if we want to attract companies here we have to attract them a variety of different ways education transportation and quality of life 

so he went to give you the last word so if you would like to address the city of Houston as to why you should be the next council member of rotisserie 

see well thank you very much and thank you both for your questions they were insightful and I appreciated having an opportunity to talk about them I got it absolutely enjoyable almost two turns as districts each city council member and I would appreciate having an opportunity to complete some of the things that we've been working on in a third term I find it very exciting to be able to drive down the streets of districts see and know that in some ways I had some effect on getting something done or that I'm working on getting something done and visiting the seventy two different civic clubs gives me a touchdown with the people that I really care about I love what I do I'd like to continue doing it and I'd like to continue being your city council member
