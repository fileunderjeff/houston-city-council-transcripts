so to begin with what we would like to hear from you jack is when you are making policy for Houstonians what are the three primary quality of life indicators that you consider when you're making decisions for the city

quality of life broadly not just environmental call your life but in general good because I think quality of life is is a balanced checkbook I think of the finances are balanced you can you can have a quality of life otherwise we're gonna be stressed for decades if we don't strain that I think also the quality of the area's been a priority of my terms on the City Council have been trying to get the city to switch over to natural gas on all their trucks so at every meeting I vote against anything that says diesel and I think with the price of gas low and availability with the fracking and shale development we could switch everything to natural gas have cleaner air cheaper energy when I first went on city council we give the mayor three years half a billion dollars for kilowatt hours can we produce our own energy plants for half a billion dollars and take advantage for ten-year contract for cheap natural gas then a big proponent nine road with the mayor and the first these cycle renting of city bikes to travel around this city traveled with her too many countries to just see what they do with their quality of life issues and in their in their environment so it's a priority in my profession I work on quality internal environment in the body and so everything we can do parks in the trees in the trash pickup the external environment becomes very important to the citizens of use to you so when talkback wildlife

there's also another aspect and so that aspect of law enforcement and how can we improve law enforcement relationships with the communities of color and the LGBT community

I think we're doing it one of the best pics I think that the mayor Parker is made is the police chief you don't see it on TV at ten o'clock news but police chief is in every community town hall meetings talking with community leaders of every color and then he has training sessions for relationships with the citizens in the LBGT community and i think is work if you watched him behind the scenes that guy cares about our security cares about the citizens relationship with the police department and as in other professions I think 97% great people on the police force the men and women that they're good in any profession you're gonna have three percent that they need to be fired he's not afraid to fire people didn't look at color he fires that have broken the law and i think is a tough enforcer but there the

one of the things that has been in the spotlight lately has been public transit in Houston so I'm curious if you wouldn't mind sharing with us what your vision of public transportation in Houston is

well behind the cue ball I think it's the multifaceted I think roadway miles rail light-rail bicycles and you know one thing we have coming on this I bet you is a form of transportation the future we're tying in with the bio greenways project nine different BIOS corporation with the county in the city and he watches hike and bike trails now and they'll be hundreds few hundred miles connected throughout the city i cant force even the waterway like in The Woodlands it they were experimenting with to be a mode of transportation talk to individual today at a luncheon took an hour and 45 minutes to get through Katie to downtown it's unacceptable and if we don't have government money we can do more light rail excellent form every great city and some of the largest cities in the world they have a good rail system of some sort so it's gotta be multifaceted and getting more people out of the cars we have to it's just it's unsustainable with the traffic patterns of today so I'd push every aspect of it except more diesel trucks

well so the next thing we like to touch on is something that's been very prominent in the news and that's the Equal Rights Ordinance and so the question is two parts do you support it equal rights ordinance and why or why not

very good question first very first week that came up and made a statement I'm not very verbose in in every debate and such that I said mr. city attorney in many cases in large cities do we have on discrimination especially in the transgender but any discrimination he said about 10 I said do we need a thirty seven-page ordinance for ten cases and I said right after that word for word on there is there a person of color and have trouble getting into a restaurant or bar call will get you in and will embarrass the establishment I think the the mayor would take the other two or three cases if they were transgender and she could fight for me I just don't think we needed a thirty seven-page ordinance to do it but still I was torn we had three hundred and fifty-seven presentations to the city and there is some tear jerking cases I mean to where it hurt to know that some of the citizens still discriminate and in that initial week I said this city really doesn't discriminate that much I had never done a discriminatory action in my life but if you enforce the law you can stop those ten cases and so I was torn in the middle and I had words after weeks of debate had words written down why I was going to be in favor of it one council member took the business exemptions from 5225 215 then I wrote words why I was going to vote against it was a tough call it really was because houstonians just don't believe in discrimination and I really truly believe that but that one percent that does I think we can stop when it took to business and heaven 15 exemptions I mean exemptions of fifteen employees at st. any small restaurant this town has to have a lawyer almost on call and then I read the section of the city attorney in describing what that proprietor had distinct and say observers to decide who goes and what better we don't need more lawyers in this we can solve 10 cases without lawyers and low business exemption 15 it's almost every business in this city has to be looking over their shoulder on all these cases of discrimination we don't need more lawsuits to enforce and be decent to every human being in the city

thank you sir so with the price of oil doing what it's doing obviously that's not good news for Houston many Houstonians are at risk of losing their jobs thousands already have so I'm curious what your ideas are about policies and programmes the city can be implementing in order to protect our economy

it's a tough question Warren Buffett if I had all those answers you know the ups and downs in the oil market has been twelve fifteen times in the past 50 years so it's inevitable like the real estate market you know do you do shut down everything just because prices dropped temporarily it will come back with the population of the world in China and India and Pakistan their population and raising their standard of living there's going to be a tremendous need for hydrocarbons so it will come back the beauty of this is this city and their leaders have taken it from an oil gas city in endeavors tremendously well survive I've got a nephew had a working in the oil industry but you smarter nobody's going to double major in here find a job some other way until it comes back because the city has thrived in and again when the mayor night travel even to the Middle East they look to this city for leadership and knowledge and experience in the oil and gas industry but got some good companies in this city there is a strong survive this fairly easy because they are smart and their investments and they've done a lot for the community so I'm a big fan of the large companies that we have here they give back to the city books charity that they've done so it will survive people may have to change jobs like they predicted thirty years ago that you just adapt to a new industry temporarily

so on to something more specific and something I guess you're familiar with your currently in the hot seat now is term limits that's going to be on the ballot do you support the three two-year terms or perhaps a 2 4 year are an alternate proposal

and why they didn't take my alternate proposal yes I think three two-year terms it's it it was an overkill and I knew the man mister clymer right that brought that in it rightfully there was some Deadwood and city government that needed to be improved upon but I think it was an overkill to go three two-year terms it's been a proposal for two four-year terms it'll be on the ballot voted against it because I wouldnt want two more years in office but an amendment was added just like the other one that said that you could benefit from it January 1 on so sitting members can benefit so I was in favor of two four-year terms until the amendment was put its a little self-serving but I told the council member of the presented that amendment I said let's not going to vote against it I'm sorry there do that but I hope it passes because you are good for your district to go additional two years here's my suggestion and it didn't get out of committee but three two-year terms you get a fourth term if you get sixty percent of the vote you get a fifth term forever to get seventy percent of that if you get seventy percent of election you doing a job so that way you keep the elder tends to lose you keep the judge some robinson's you keep the gym Greenwood's ones that deserve longer terms because now we have short-sighted City Council members and sometimes the mayor of China and Japan they have 25 fifty-year goals we have two to six year goals it's not right believe in longer limits but I think if you are in it should have more more than the six years

for shifting gears a little bit you actually started this whole segment off talking about the city's pocketbook so certainly one of the biggest hurdles right now facing his pocketbook is unfunded pension liability so I'm curious if you wouldn't mind sharing with us your ideas are for addressing the current situation and what should we be doing to prevent ourselves from from ending up in the same situation again years down the road

very good question that that should be the key question in the mayor's race are you willing to do you have the stature to stop away stop the unsustainable pension system give you an example and and in the Greater Houston Partnership in the taxpayers are mad because nobody else has a retirement system like some of the groups and so that the problem one and they're great people don't get me wrong the men and women of the fire department need people and hard-working but they got locked into in 2001 given away the ranch we don't have the range to give away anymore I got locked into it put their lock box and Austin we either have to bring that lockbox back to Usdan or negotiate sit down and negotiate words technically they don't have to so first six months in office I asked the mayor mayor do you mind if I negotiate with them so I had the firefighters pension board in my office and their lobbyists and just say just give me the cost of living just give me a little bit of the guaranteed investments and they really never had to negotiate they were in a strong position but now with the business community and the taxpayers realizing these or pension benefits nobody else has one of the press conference is the mayor where she was soon somebody and the fire department I hit thirty year Exxon retiree said you have a pension like that not even close to give you one example it's the worst case I could get out of the consultant 52 years old you just put in thirty years I hand you a check for $750,000 and I guarantee you a hundred and forty-seven percent of your highest salary in those thirty years the rest of your life you can't do that and I love the firefighters and says but they have to have their union to to bring that down citizens can afford it city can afford it it'll be structurally imbalanced budget for decades if we don't look at illinois's you know they can't afford what they do they can't even pay their lottery winners chicago is headed in the state of Illinois detroit Mayor correct me say we're not Detroit we will be if we stay on this course will have to take money away from parks and libraries and streets it's just it's serious so it should be the number one issue and mayor's race in the boaters need to hold that promise accountable fix it in two years 63 they don't you shouldn't vote for him it's that serious

so along the same lines of by judy is one part of the budget is infrastructure you seen as one of the largest cities in the us- and tackling the infrastructure is going to be challenging so how do you think the sea should tackle its infrastructure issues and how you pay for it

I wasn't on city council and they they put the drainage fee and but in government that's federal and city and state we've gotta start paying as you go i mean we're putting off debt and federal governments the worst at it is is just putting people in debt more and more and they say that you are 18 trillion dollars and then federal government that you add the responsibility of medicare and medicaid which will bankrupt the federal government it gets to 34 billion trillion dollars in debt you know it's wrong for your kids and your grandkids it's wrong so to have infrastructure paid as you go and paying down debt at the same I think it's a good deal of you my fiscal conservatives will slap me upside the head and say Christie you know but you know it's hard to pay off that credit card at the end of the month you can't keep paying more and more interest in China as you by the throat Saudi Arabia Japan they had the debt that we have to pay off so you know I they not in control of our future thank them for loaning the money but we shouldn't be borrowing that much you shouldn't have an imbalance checkbook at home and you shouldn't to the city's I'm in favor of the attempt that they're doing put more and more money back and infrastructure I think New York City is some water and sewer lines 1997 years old you can't you can't just live with hundred breaks every day on wall street you know it's it's gotta be done and it's tough to ask the voters to be patient you know we've got 640 square miles in this city and six or eight thousand lion miles of roads that have drainage with it at sea level we have to invest in the future but it's got to be smart investing and not just or death

so shifting gears a little bit from sort of government spending to individual houstonians I'm curious whether you we've seen this this trend in some larger cities I'm curious whether you support raising the minimum wage and and why or why not

well these are good questions I worked for minimum wage job through high school and college and was happy to get it course is even less now when you think about someone trying to live and if they have a child or to you know go to college I hurt to where I couldn't make it on $7.25 an hour I would probably be in favor again my fiscal conservative buddies would slap me upside the head but graduating that is not good $15 tomorrow their last stats that you go to $15 you're gonna lose all these lo peor lot of these low paying to even the ones that are happy with minimum wage they can be gone and you you lose being economic catastrophe with small business that thrive on on low wages but so I'd be somewhere in the middle not going to $15 tomorrow it should give hitting others no I mean but he graduated up some towards reasonable just reasonable I just always pay any high school that works in the office and said she just above the minimum wage just because you no problem cost $1000 nowadays they can make it and seven $7.25 an hour

so you still has a mayor-council form of government and most of the power resides with the mayor but given this form of government how do you feel that you would be able to make a change if elected

well there's disagree agreement on city council you know it's a strong mayor's position and fortunately we've been blessed with some good manners didn't abused his positions and so I didn't see a problem with letting them continue setting the agenda work on the budget so we have a voice that unless its nine votes we don't have veto power some of the council members want to have just a few people put things on the ballot in a sixteen people you an absolute extremes so you just don't wanna spend 18 hour days dealing with the discussions of the extreme so highlights the status quo that's from I just think better way to do it you you work with the power structure the mayor tired from different parties but we trust each other anything I asked her a citizen's complainer whatever gets done and and you know if you deal with respect and honesty and fairness you know those officials the ones that have known that the mayors in the past they want what's best for this city is not just hand-to-hand combat politics and getting back at people I work with the system the way it is and I can get things done working with the powerful mayor's position than trying to skirt it and have coalitions to usurp the mayor's power issues newly-elected the previous mayors duly-elected their votes and that's what the city one so you work with the number one spot you can be a city council member and say I'm bigger than my own so anyway I like negotiation compromise trusting each other that's the pretty part of public service but as some other parts to

dr. Kristi I want to thank you so much for joining us tonight we're getting near the end of our time with you so I would like to give you just a moment if you'd like to address the viewers here watching at home and talk to them about why you want to stay council member for a large five and why they should vote for you

ok I just enjoy public service I'm not too sure if I enjoy politics but I knew that I could offer just like the State Board of Education in the local school board have something to offer that's that's pure as far as serving the public and in the city of Houston I saw great challenges and that's again balancing the budget that working with Harris County I think that was so important they weren't working together this city and the county they're working together now I think a cleaner environment use of natural gas another area that the mayor put me on was the the medical costs we were eighteen million dollars in the in the in the red today three and a half years later we're we're at 37 42 million in the black and that's by teaching employees i think is 36 37,000 employees and retirees how to take care of themselves that health is the entity not disease a disease curious care system halfway there just teaching what quitting smoking will do exercise and eating right you can prevent disease I mean all of them and so I like those challenges I think more has to be done those in an international mayor put me on the international scene where we've been to maybe seventeen countries selling Houston court abused in the Medical Center NASA and the restaurants here so good city its number one and a lot of areas the energy industry and we're selling it throughout the world that this is the place to come if you want business good business and friendly people that's why I'm running
