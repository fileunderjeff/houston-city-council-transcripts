well we're gonna jump right in with the tough stuff unfunded pension liability it's a major issue for the City of Houston what are your ideas on how to address the current pension issues and how to how would you prevent similar issues from happening in the future

well it's it's an important question for the city to face right now and and there's been no shortage of discussion at the horseshoes through the first year and a half of my first term here we're really looking at that in a number of ways but through the budget and fiscal affairs committee of this of the city council and in this case we know that we have three pension funds that of the municipal employees and police officers as well as the firefighters all three of those pensions are important for the reasons you stayed ultimate sustainability within the financial budget of the city and they are however unequal in how they are governed and regulated and I think to get to a position where the city has more fundamental responsibility for how they are operated in particular with the firefighters is a very important issue with legislative control in Austin that's something that City Council has really been handcuffed with regards to any opportunity to get to the table to meet and confer in a in a positive form I think we do have an excellent relationship with or firefighters who do such important work for us as with the police officers in our municipal employees so we we owe it to our employees and a special especially those who have made promises to to hold our promises as we go forward but to get to a place where we have more sustainable models we need to have a really functional government that works with counsel with our Austin delegation of elected officials and in that regard it is of utmost importance that we have open dialogue with all parties so the city can be securing its future as well as our first offenders and important public servants thank you so in this city is largest used in building and maintaining infrastructure is a real challenge true course

how do you think the city should tackle its infrastructure issues including we want to know how how to pay for it

right well I guess been naive if you didn't know a little bit about real rebuild Houston which is what the drainage fee as some people are drainage tax even call it but what we've been doing to pay down the debt of a fund that pays for infrastructure projects and really in a transparent way is a lock box as we voted as the citizens of Houston in 2010 it now I think working in to that legacy that program is building both road and drainage projects for our city we need to continue to administrate that program in a way that is transparent efficient utilizing all the best technology I think part of perhaps what I bring to the council is my experience in the public realm and as a practicing architect some of those details whether year old firm believer in complete streets or in studying the floodplain we know a lot of information about where the most important projects need to go and we need to be very careful with our money and those tax dollars that are precious to us so that we are good stewards of our resources and spread that around the city in a way that is fair to all parts of town and as as we say in the city address the worst first and that's that's a challenging program it's something difficult to live up to but I think we are in the process of getting into our stride I think the new relatively new now Director of Public Works and engineering is a good man and he is administrating the program very well but we we can do better and I think that's something that we are all putting our shoulder to the wheel for council member

when candidates speak of crime prevention they often proposed a formula of more cops equals less crime but in reality the systemic causes of crime are linked to issues of education poverty of opportunity what crime intervention and prevention policies do you support the systemic address crime

well I've had the pleasure in the benefit of sitting on the horseshoe next to our former chief of police CEO Bradford who has been a wonderful colleague I think I'm on the council as well as someone who has spent a great deal of time developing a program that he calls community policing and that's something that really speaks to me in the experience that i've had as a neighborhood leader in a community activist really in ways that relate to our city of Houston super Neighborhood Association program and and where I have served as a neighborhood leader we're familiar in our part of town as in other parts of Houston where with the pit program the partnership in crime prevention and that is something that we really we need to engage with HPD there's been a fairly well that it process of analysis trying to look carefully at the way that we do our policing right now and what is recommended for going forward and I think we're we're taking account of some of those recommendations in trying to implement them I think you're right to ask the question about whether more cops in cars is going to be the sole solution but I think we can be smarter and more efficient and I think in in ways that we've seen across the country there need to be a more open dialogue between citizens in Houston in the police I think our chief mcclelland understands that in principle and he is moving forward to to actuate on that council member you mentioned community policing and and for those that don't know when you're watching this if you could explain what your sense of what those mean and how they would specifically address systemic issue well I think from my experience a lot can be gained from in another sense meeting in conferring in this case between our officers and administrators of the police force as well as our community citizens getting together in a public forum in the library or public space someone somewhere where facilities offered to us being in a school or church these are places that we can access as public officials and as an at-large councilmember I will tell you that I work with all of the district council members in all 11 of our districts and that there are there different problems in different parts of towns with which is not a surprise but it's something that it suggests that there would not be a one size fits all solution for Houston and the different types of crime emerged and are more prevalent in different parts of town so we have to be smart about that I know I just spoke with an officer in his cruiser few blocks from here and it's interesting you you get a real sense that they know the territory and some of those we used to call beat cops you know they're the boots on the ground they know what's going on I've got great faith in our police officers I i feel i have excellent dialogue with both representatives of the Union as well as the brats in the force in this is it's very important for us to link up some of what we do in neighborhood leadership where citizens can feel empowered there are you know plenty of Houstonians they don't have a computer and rely on their neighbors and the little lady down the street the classic example of someone who relies on her community for news and if there is urgent issues that are surrounding us many of us are informed by smartphones and and Internet alerts and advisories but we've got a we've gotta work on this together and I think that's part of the VIP model and what community policing can really do if we open it up to the citizens of Houston

thank you for expanding on that was similarly not everybody has access to the Internet not everybody has a computer not everybody has a car in Houston either mister how what is your vision for public transportation in transit as it relates to Houston in kind of what's happening right now

well I am a big believer in public transportation and happy to say that in a day or two from today Metro will be unveiling its new re-imagined system network for its bus service which is really the backbone of our system is what we've built on we have absolutely efficient parking right system second to none in the nation and those things are great for those suburban commuters who are trying to get officially into town it's very tempting and worthwhile way to save time in the morning rush hour in the evening to get only get to work in the morning by way of the bus system in and some of those high-speed lanes so expanding on that I do believe is part of the solution I I am a believer that concrete is not always the solution in its own inner modles systems by that we mean the light rail is coming and I think about to really be a marvelous asset for the City of Houston and something that we can really celebrate as we come up with Final Four and the Super Bowl coming to town in the next few years so there there's exciting things happening but whether it's bus rapid transit like what we see that's going to be taking place on the Post Oak order in uptown or some of what we're seeing now here in the east and where the Harrisburg line and Southeast line are accessing some of our universities in a way that I i see all the time I think we need to continue to expand that program

thank you know because the Houston equal rights ordinance is going to be on the ballot is going to be an issue that folks are gonna be talking about and we would like to know do you support these legal rights ordinance and whether or not

I do and I voted for it last summer and again just a couple of weeks ago when it came back to us from the Texas Supreme Court so I think putting it to the ballot hopefully will be used in some finality on that I do think it's of utmost importance that we pass that lets do we find ourselves in some kind of territory like other states where we've been they've been subject to some embarrassment by their discriminatory and in some ways offensive behavior but I think inclusion as as we've talked about in history as the art of history pointing in a direction I think it's clearly towards inclusion and it's been pointed out by a number of my colleagues in the horseshoe that there's it's their 16 categories of individuals that are protected under this ordinance including veterans pregnant women the elderly free she's of age race gender and a variety of other categories in for all of these reasons I think we are unique among Great American cities in these are united states that do not have similar ordinance and I think for those reasons is time to simply get this thing done and move on we have a tremendous amount of things that we really need to be focused on while I feel this is an important thing for us to get through I think there's other things that we need to be focused on

with her last few minutes left we do we do when we have time for you to address the voters directly but just quickly with oil prices well below $60 a barrel many Houstonians are at risk of losing their jobs and thousands already have this right what policies and programs should be in place to protect our city's economy

well I think one thing we've done in the last few decades frankly is diversify our portfolio of solid business performers who had with the Texas Medical Center with the transportation hubs of international airports and the fantastic evidence and in truth behind the port of houston we have a much more diverse portfolio then we did say in the eighties when the oil and gas prices really came to a head with are much more monolithic culture when we were so focused on petroleum-based products and now I think with that diversification didn't even mention the Texas Medical Center largest medical center in the world we are blessed houston is a fantastic place for all of these things in your right johnnie the economy is constricting in certain sectors and we're hoping that the price of oil lantern and there's some projections that that's going to be heading in the right direction here shortly I think we need to do everything we can to help manufacturing to help those who are the job creators out there as a small business owner I know that are very reliant on the state of our economy here and I think we we we need to do very well what

thank you so much for the conversation we will give you the last minute to dress the voters directly and tell them why they should reelect you to Houston City Council at-large position to
