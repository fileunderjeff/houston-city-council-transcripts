let's just start out swinging here unfunded pension liability to major issue for the City of Houston what are your ideas about how to address the current pension issues and how to prevent similar situations in the future

well i i think that there's not a singular fix on the issue number one the single largest cause is that the city has over multiple years determined not to pay what is called the arc or the the asking amount as opposed to what the legal amount we are supposed to pay so that's it's the different sort of like your your basic pledge in your maximum pledged so we've not been paying the maximum pledged to keep up I don't think there'll be a singular fix I think there will be a multiple level level six remember that we have three major pension plans we have the municipal pension plan which is some people indicated about 60% to 70% funded fully funded now I understand that's over a thirty or forty year time period not all of those deaths are due tomorrow we have the police pension fund which is about 75 to 85 percent fully funded and we have the firefighters police pension fund which is by some accounts as much as 95% fully funded remember that the police in the firefighters in their service to the city are not paid social security so this pension matters it really is there only line of retirement benefits to other than what they may have saved in worked for so I think what's gonna have to happen is that as we look towards the issues of bringing back some some levels of local control in relationship to potentially the firefighters pension we know that the the meet and confer has already happened with police and hope I think there were gonna have to look at some combination of things shared costs by employees I think we're gonna have to look at some reduction in future salaries benefits not the current salaries benefits the future hires benefits I think we're going to have to look at some potentials of 401k type programs proposed hopefully on steroids but most importantly what we're gonna need to have and this is where the electorate becomes very important we're gonna have to elect a mayor that's going to be able to sit down with some level of trust of all of those pension programs and say here's where we want to go in and bring the employees along with them without scaring people I think the singular most important thing that we do right now is that we need to have a sober business-like conversation and we need to stop scaring people about the pension liabilities do we have a delicious do we have debt we need to pay yes is it a crisis know is it fixable absolutely I believe we can fix it if we use the Houston model just sitting down using common sense in coming to a good program together next question council member as Houston continues to grow

what is your vision for public transportation

will I i think for the long haul we're going to continue to be a car centric city and we need to recognize that it's just we're just so large that and we're an independent group of people we like to get in our car and go when we want to go other forms of transit transportation are much more limited in scope and its size and where we're in time and so on so forth I strongly support all levels of increased public transportation whether that be rail local rail where there'd be regional rail whether it be inter-regional rail between Dallas and the other cities I think that's going to be phenomenally important because we just probably can't continue to expand our airports beyond what we already have now clearly that that intermodal form of transportation continues to be important not only intercontinental from an international standpoint but now as we open up a new international gates at Hobby even more so but on the on the local level it's it's so much about streets and sidewalks it's going to be more and more about bikeways where we can get those to happen it's going to be more and more about an inter connected use between Metro I'm really excited to see how this new Metro plan is going to work district J which is in southwest Houston will probably be the singularly largest connected or affected area on these new bus lines in our workforce that lives there will be impacted on being able to get everywhere else whether it's downtown or to other parts of the city let me remind you about who we are and district a hundred and eighty thousand souls strong we are the Ellis Island in the city where as many as 85 different language communities were three times more densely populated than the rest of the city with 9,000 people per square mile where the rest of city has about 3,100 per people per square mouth so this public transportation component becomes vitally important but we are also an average household income of $30,000 so public transportation is important to this community what differentiates us from the rest of the city in addition to our compact is our housing stock 75,000 housing units at which 60,000 or apartments so people are walking out of the door looking for a way to get somewhere else as soon as possible and we need to continue to provide maximum efficiencies on all of those levels of our intermodal transportation system

thank you the next question is about the economy with oil prices below $50 about iran now many Houstonians are at risk for losing their jobs in fact many already have policies and programs should be in place from a city perspective and from your position and city council to protect our city's economy

well of course the very basic level from the city's operational standpoint it's about how do we manage our budget that's really what it comes down to a and in that sense I think we have put forth a budget for the next fiscal year and we will be in an ongoing conversations with the next mayor about next budgets the current some people suggest we believe that we put forward a balanced budget according to all economic indicators some people suggest that we may be facing as much as 20 million dollar deficit remember that we also potentially face that last year we manage our way through the city's budget and through the city's fiscal year it to the end of the day we didn't have that so I think it's very important that we continue to be very conservative in our spending very conservative in our prognostications about the monies that coming in and I think we need to continue from us from a CDS management standpoint to the directly on point to make sure that our dollars are being spent in the best way in the most effective and efficient way part of the challenges that we have with that lindsey is that as we are doing public construction projects are costs because because of the economy has historically been so strong here in the last several years is our cost for construction is going through the roof so we now or are seeing increases of 20 to 30 percent over what we thought we had so far dollars are not able to go quite as far so good to me is that very carefully next question council member

in a city is largest Houston building and maintaining infrastructure is the challenge how do you think the city should tackle its in infrastructure issues including how to pay for it

well as you know we currently have a rebuild Houston program for all basic purposes that was sold to the public as a pay-as-you-go program I think that is a fiscally responsible way to approach the issue the challenge has been with that will have you pay as you go if you pay down debt first so we've been paying down some debt so we've had some we've had some the pain on the front we've not gotten as much construction dollars per dollar per traction foot per dollar on the front end because we've been paying down there as we paid larger sections of that debt more and more dollars will go we will go into the fund to make sure that we have more for construction as we move forward I i generally support the idea of rebuild Houston if the court say that we need to put it back before the public will certainly vote to do that I think it is a fiscally prudent approach to not have debt as we move forward with construction as much as possible

one thing that the courts did put back to the people was the Houston equal rights ordinance is serving in city council when he sneaked all rights ordinance was passed did you support the Equal Rights Ordinance do you support it going forward and what is your opinion on that

I I was given the privilege of listening to hours and hours and hours of testimony from historians across the board I ultimately did vote for the creation of the Houston equal rights ordinance and I also voted to place it on the ballot because I think it's important that we not only follow the law but we follow the court's dictates and now the people will have the ability within their own conscience is to vote according their heart let me tell you why I voted for it to begin with and here's a statistic that matters 89% in Minnesota again 89% of the residential source of the souls that with industry J are people of color they are african-american they are Latino their Asian and they are other communities that historically been discriminated against I don't know how a person who looks like me represents a district like that does not take into consideration the day-to-day lives of those people and provide for them a low-cost entry point to justice in the courts of appeal in that sense additionally I think that we the the ordinance is provided or would provide an opportunity for a relief valves in this post Ferguson era for people who believe that they have been harmed in some way to end a low-cost entry point come before a tribunal to get their issues hard to move forward because the the ultimate issue here is whether justice is being done for people and whether we are an international city we are a magnificent cities across the globe and I i think that this city is structurally and emotionally and sophisticated in in moving forward to address these issues of equality across the board and I think we want to send that message to the rest of the world that we with you come to Houston you're going to do well because we're not we're going to make sure that you have an equal chance

next question what are the three primary quality of life indicators that you would use as a metric to develop policy around and serve your constituents

well I think they just have to be the basics have to be infrastructure they have to be quality of life crime-related neighborhood and then they have today bringing communities together to begin where they they want to be involved in 10 years I've been very fortunate to be able to be council member of an area that in the past we've done more in the past four years than in many places get to do in six years were from an infrastructure perspective we've put new Bellaire Boulevard on the ground 25 + million dollars were about to do a new reconstruction of Fondren which were not only address traffic concerns but flooding concerns help the short-chain Civic Association replace its wall there I've been able to leverage the cans of dollars that we have their for quality of life in improvement in our parks because that goes to the nature of neighborhood qualities that people want to buy a home they're looking at number one the price point looking at to the schools if they're young families and looking at prices this I've been able to bring to the table new dollars for a new spray park in Lansdale a new walking pavilion new walking trail in crane Park a new family pavilion and Lansdale new swimming pool in Sharpstown any new skatepark in the gulf in community and that story alone is an inspirational story where the kids have inspired themselves and gone out and design their own skate park it's very exciting so its quality of life its neighborhoods its bout in its about crime reduction in addition to that not only have we been working with HPD but we've also been working with this new constable the new council districts Service Fund as you are aware and as part of that I was able to dedicate $273,000 for service activities that that's funded 6900 extra police hours in the in the short term the area and the Westwood area and in the the greater 59 area panhandling focus we issued over 600 nearly 700 citations for panhandling in that area prostitution we had like a hundred and forty-one different arrests and we had a number of major felony arrests over in the major violent crime is initiative that we've had in a short span area so I've been very fortunate to be able to bring those dollars to the community and work with comedic lastly I think what we have to do is to continue to work with our individual neighborhoods to help them understand where they are now and where they want to be three four and five years down the road and to begin to plan for that and I look forward to working with the neighborhood to do that

but we only have a few minutes left if you'd like to look into the camera and speak directly to the voters as to why they should vote for you to continue being their city council member for District
